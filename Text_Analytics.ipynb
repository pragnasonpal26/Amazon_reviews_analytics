      "['Sound not good at all my jbl bluetooth speaker sounds better than this... Update on review for those having issues with sound here are the steps to resolve. Press and hold the Microphone off and Volume down buttons at the same time until the light ring turns orange (about 20 seconds). Then the light ring will turn blue.2. Wait for the light ring to turn off and on again. The light ring will then turn orange again as your device enters setup mode.3. Open the Alexa app to connect your device to a Wi-Fi network and register it to your Amazon ac\\r\\n            ', \"I love this little guy.  After returning Beats Solo 2 headphones (painfully tight) and a Bose Soundlink color 2  (not so good),  I purchased this Echo from Staples (didn't want to possibly return a third item to Amazon).  I don't have a lot to say except that I am so happy with it.  Of course its only been one day, so time will tell.  I think the sound quality is very good.  The hands free aspect is great, play a song, set a timer, set an alarm,  reminder,  whats the weather,  get the news,  how many teaspoons in a tablespoon,  you get the idea.  The best yet for me is the ability to tell it to make a phone call.  What a wonderful feature for someone who lives alone.  I'm no audiophile but to me it sounds better than the Bose.  All in all, I think this is a great buy especially now when its on sale.\\r\\n            \", 'We’re pretty fully into the Amazon Echo’s. We’ve got two bigger echos and three dots. This was bought to replace a dot, and I have to say I’m impressed.First off it looks so much nicer than the original. Before the echo was very sterile looking. Now it looks much more classy and inviting. Almost like it belongs in the home / matches the decorè much more seemlessly. The fabric is very welcoming and appreciated. The size is more manageable, too.We played the same song on both the new and old speakers. While it’s not something that is going to blow you away, it is pretty significantly clearer, vocals are cleaner, and bass is more full. The sound was good enough for us to replace the one in the kitchen and move that one in the old dot location.It also has a coax connection for other sources as well. This is not something the original had, so that’s a nice touch (even though most manufacturers are steering away from coax)The bad? I liked the volume ring that you could turn. I know it’s one of those things that cost extra, and you can use your voice and the volume buttons, but I still enjoyed having the ring.\\r\\n            ', 'Update: Amazon has pushed a software update and sound quality now sounds great.I was originally disappointed in the 2nd Gen as my original review (below) shows.  Shortly after posting the review Amazon reached out to me for additional information.  They contacted me again today and said they took my, and others, feedback regarding the sound quality seriously.  The Amazon rep informed me my Echo was selected to be part of a test group asked me if I would want to install a new software update to address the problem.  She walked me through the steps to ensure the update was applied and asked me to test the audio (she stayed on the phone while I did this).With my 2nd Gen and original 1st Gen Echo in a multi-room group (that\\'s a really nice feature) I had Alexa fire up my playlist.  I was surprised to find the 2nd Gen now sounded much improved.  As I walked between rooms with the two Echo\\'s I was also surprised that the 2nd Gen sounded better than my 1st Gen, the bass and mid-range had a better quality.  Not believing my own ears I had my wife also give it a listen and she agreed.The Amazon rep said they were working with a small group of customers like me to verify the update and they would be pushing the update to all customers very soon (update to my update, looks like Amazon is now pushing out the software broadly!).  You can check your software version by using the Alexa app and looking at your Echo device settings. FYI, after the update my Gen2 shows Device Software Version 592452420 (the original was 592452320).Other than audio, the Gen 2 is nearly identical to the original Gen 1 with exception of form factor.  The Gen 2 is shorter (5.9\") and wider (3.5\").  For comparison Gen 1 was 9.2\" x 3.3\".  The Gen 2 has many \\'skin\\' options, I chose the fabric option. Comparatively the Gen 1 had a look of plastic and metal.  The Gen 2 cover is removable so you can replace with other skins.As for responsiveness, Gen 2 specs show better microphone array.  From my use I\\'ve not noticed anything improved. That said I was very happy with the Gen 1 responsiveness to commands, the Gen 2 continues to be as responsive.All other functions seem to be the same as Gen 1 including blue ring that indicates \"listening\", buttons on top to activate for \"Alexa\" and button to mute the microphone array. There is also a 3.5mm jack port and bluetooth to connect to other speakers. There is a design change, with Gen 1 you would turn the ring to change volume, that\\'s been replaced with +/- buttons (following same design change as the Dot releases).---[Original Review - 1 Star]---I bought my first Amazon Echo back in 2014.  Since then I\\'ve added a second Echo (1st gen), a tap and 3 dots.  I\\'ve added Vaux Cordless Home Speaker\\xa0VAUX Cordless Home Speaker + Portable Battery for Amazon Echo Dot Gen 2 Gray/Ash\\xa0to two of my Dots.  I\\'ve given Echo as gifts.  In other words I\\'m all in on Amazon Echo system and have been for a long time.Amazon advertises this as 2nd Generation as \"improved sound\".  I thought the original Echo (1 gen) sounded great so I fell for the 2nd gen hook, line and sinker.  Unfortunately after listening to it I find it\\'s a sinker indeed, or perhaps a stinker.I did an informal test with my 1st gen and new 2nd gen Echo.  I had them both play a set of songs.  I\\'m just going by what my set of ears tells me, but the 2nd gen is DISAPPOINTING when it comes to sound quality.  While it does seem to have a deeper bass, the overall quality sounds tinnier than the 1st gen.  Whatever \"powered by Dolby\" is supposed to bring to the 2nd get unit is not much, this 2nd gen is just not up to par with the original when it comes to audio.The unit otherwise functions like the original and other than the form factor I see nothing that\\'s an improvement.  I haven\\'t seen that it \"hears\" better.  And it doesn\\'t sound better for sure.Perhaps I\\'m too focused on the sound of Echo 2nd gen, but when Amazon makes it a point to expressly market it as being \"improved sound\", I\\'d expect the sound to be noticeably improved. It doesn\\'t and therefore give it a 1 star rating.\\r\\n            ', 'Really love the Echo!  It\\'s great for us seniors who rely on lists and reminders to keep us organized.  Just tell Alexa \"add flour to shopping list\" and instantly its there.  No more losing my shopping list as it is always on my phone.  Also love asking for any kind of music I\\'m in the mood for. I can tell her \"play some soft rock from the 70\\'s\" and she finds the best.First thing in the morning I ask for the weather and news to get the day started.  When I\\'m cooking, I ask her to \"set the timer for 30 minutes\" and it\\'s done!  I plan to order the smart bulbs for my lamps next so I can tell her to turn lights on/off.I also want to get a smart thermostat so I can tell her to turn the heat/air up/down.

So the last thing I need is him tripping over something in the dark, trying to turn lights on!!I have an Echo & Dot in my room, which I mostly use to stream music with my Amazon Music Unlimited.I was controlling even his bedroom light & the hallway light with the app on my phone as well as my Echo.So I bought two more Dots during prime day sale.It\\'s been a game changer!!  My Dad struggled, even with the app on his phone to control the lights. Now that we have a Dot in his bedroom & an Echo & Dot in the living room, he\\'s very easily learned how to ask Alexa to turn on the hallway light, his bedroom light when he\\'s going to bed!! NO MORE STUMBLING AROUND IN THE DARK or trying to remember where he put his flashlight!!Since the Echo Dots all sync together, once he gets to his bedroom, he tells Alexa to turn off the living room light & the hallway light when he gets to his bedroom!!  This little device is a SAVING GRACE, not only for my Dad, but for me!! I don\\'t have him calling me to \"Show me again how to turn the lights on/off\" with his phone app!!It\\'s like having someone else here that helps me take care of my Dad!!I made a list of the commands for the lights, etc & hung one on his night stand & put the other beside his chair in the living room!!He\\'s also exploring, BY HIMSELF, different commands for Alexa. I\\'ve heard him ask her about the weather, baseball scores, etc. THIS LITTLE ITEM IS A TRUE GEM FOR SENIORS!! I love mine just as much & the quality of the sound thru the Echo is AMAZING for listening to music.  I\\'m VERY PICKY about sound quality!! I have Bose speakers hooked up to my TV & have Bose ear buds as well.  The quality of the sound from the Echo is just as good as Bose speakers!!\\r\\n            ', 'These are great for sharing music across multiple rooms, and for having Alexa available in those rooms.  Some things you need to know though.* Although this supports playing music in multiple rooms, it appears that Alexa only allows each room to be in a single group.  So if I have a speaker in my study and sometimes I want to the music shared there sometimes, but not always, I can’t do that.  I also have not yet found an Alexa command that let’s me take existing music and just add a speaker to it, or expand it to a larger area (i.e. “Alexa, play this music in the study too” or “Alexa, play this music in the downstairs group”) - instead you have to restart the music you’re listening to (i.e. “Alexa, shuffle Bob Seger songs downstairs”). ‘* The speaker quality in this is pretty high quality.  I’ve gone through probably a dozen Bluetooth speakers, some of them quite expensive, and I think I’ve only heard one (JBL) that was higher quality.  With that said, if you want even higher quality, you should consider Sonos speakers with Alexa built in.* Alexa itself is good, but not great.  If you’ve never used voice commands, you may experience some frustration with Alexa.  But if you only want to use this to play music in multiple rooms and for simple tasks (i.e. “set a timer”) then you’ll be pretty happy with these.\\r\\n            ', 'What a cool product.

I decided that for Christmas and my birthday (just a few short weeks after Christmas) I was going to get one. Instead of searching my wish list for the Echo I had added long ago, I decided to just search for it. And so glad I did, because the 2nd gen popped up, and at a smaller price point at that (I did pick up when on discount for holiday after all). I anxiously awaited the delivery, which happened to be a day earlier that what I was told it would be, and I immediately tore into the package as soon as it arrived. I have been loving it. I use it to set up a backup alarm to wake up to, I get my news flashes from Alexa, Ive played trivia with Alexa, and she is great at helping find just the right music to listen to. Oh, and did I mention, she can control my Fire TV as well!! I have loved it so much, I decided to look into the Echo dot to put throughout the house, especially the kids room so that I don't have to leave my phone in there playing music till they fall asleep when over at my house. So the New Year comes and goes, and I decide that I was pretty good the previous year, and my birthday was in just a couple weeks, I went ahead and bought 2 Echo dots to go with it. The only regret so far is that my 5 year old daughter won't quit asking Alexa to tell her jokes lol. I highly recommend.

Seeing how the Heather Gray and the Sandstone colored echoes hopped into my shopping cart (story I told hubby) I figured it shouldn't be too hard to find a place in the house they could stay.Well the Heather Gray echo looks very nice in our bedroom and the Sandstone looks great in the kitchen. A tiny little white echo Dot (super cute)  also stowed away in the cart... all three of them get along great with each other, even our original Alexa. They are grouped together in our Alexa app and can function singly or as a group.Not wanting to sound disloyal to our original Alexa, these newer models do sound better, a little bit more bass than I like but still better. The sound is deeper and richer. It could be it's because they're new, or maybe it's because Alexa had been dropped one too many times, whatever the reason they sound great and response time is quick.We have them set up to control the lights and the fans around the house using a few Wi-Fi plugins and I can also have them play the same music at the same time if I ask Alexa to play through the group I set up, ....which is great because not only does the echo have room filling sound by themselves, but as a group they completely fill the entire house with sound, love it! 😍I love these echoes, including our original one. They are used daily for one thing or another, it's so simple to set alarms, timers, play music, ask questions, make phone calls, text someone on my contact list, even play games. It's very easy to get used to having and using them in your daily routine, they are  habit forming for sure and once you have one adding a few more makes the experience even better! 😊\\r\\n            \", 'So far loving it, which it has a google look feature. It is VERY limited on researching and typically goes to wikpedia in a round about way. I\\'m still learning how to \"command\". Can be frustrating as all get out.

My favorite I using it for music and also the app is on my phone so plug and play in the car! You can ask to play play lists on amazon prime music and then ask to add a song you like in that moment of hearing it, to your amazon music library which is same on your app on cellphone. The best feature is the amazing SOUND.......omg. Even on low or loud volume you can say \"Alexa\" and it will hear you with a special layered (?) speaker and stop and wait for your command. I have yet to try making phone calls through it as you have to go into the site and log in and add permissions for contacts/add. It does keep everything you say in the amazon site\\'s app log and you have to go log into delete and its delete all or not. Just keep that in mind, site says its for Alexa to \"learn you\" yet your information is out there.

I am male, aged 75 years old, and more tech savvy than most people my age, but if you can use a modern computer, and own one, you should have not problem using this device. IT IS SO FAR, MIRACULOUS, and intriguing! I bought mine about a week ago, and waited till a couple days ago to jump in with \"both feet\" and set it up. Even though I once did computer tech support for Dell computers, It was a long time ago now, and a lot of tech has evolved since then, and i have the same fear of new things as most people my age, though admittedly higher skills. I also own an Iphone 6s plus, of which I have mixed emotions. The Iphone is made by apple, and  Apple\\'s idea of \"intuitive\" and mine are very different. Microsoft is much better at designing \"intuitive\" into an operating system than Apple. Aniyway, You will need some type of connected WIFI device to use this product. (read that Cell Phone with it\\'s own WIFI abilities, and Bluetooth built in) You will need to download the \"Alexa App. \" on that device to set up the Alexa products.From that point on, simply plug in the Echo device into a regular 110V. wall outlet, it comes with a plug in adapter. There are no batteries in this device, although some have them.  A NOTE HERE\" YES, YOU CAN UNPLUG IT WITHOUT  IT LOSING ITS BRAINS AND REQUIRING REPEAT SET UP. So though not specified anywhere I read it evidently has some on board nonvolatile memory built in that will allow this. ( i  spent several research sessions attempting to find this out, and finally had to bite the bullet and just try it. ) I moved it from one room location to another and within a few seconds it greeted me and said it was operational.  NOW I AM ONLY AN OLD GUY WITH PRETTY GOOD HEARING ABILITIES YET, (NOT EXACTLY AN AUDIOPHILE ) BUT WITH DOLBY DIGITAL SOUND, THIS IS ONE NICE SOUNDING SPEAKER SYSTEM,FULLY AS GOOD AS MY 7 SPEAKER ALTECH LANSING ON MY PC. IT MAY EVEN BE BETTER.IF YOU HAVE A NORMAL EAR, YOU WILL BE AMAZED AT THE SOUND QUALITY!Now I am still learning about this product. Every new thing I try I am pleasantly surprised. I plan to get at least a smart home door lock and thermostat to use with it in the future, and several light switches.  I am no great fan of the \"RING DOORBELL\"  (due to frequently needed battery recharging) at this point, but I understand Amazon has purchased that company and will soon have an interface app available to use with the \"Ring System\" If you want to keep up with the march of technology, this device is probably your best doorway to that end, since Amazon is committed to pursuing it. Others may drop out along the way. (NEW) I made a hands free phone call to my son this moring as a test of the phone capabilities. Sound on my end was like he was in the room. The Alexa app and it\\'s capabilities are evolving technologies. Features will be added. (Mine did an update download while playing music) Don\\'t be disappointed. It is attractively packed, and very capable, but the \"instructions\" are not detailed and are sketchy. Lean about it online as I did before you purchase it. Read as many reviews as your eyes and attention span will allow, and take the plunge! An education awaits you!\\r\\n            ', 'After moving into my studio condo permanently, I realized I needed a speaker for music. I tried to find something that would have Alexa and connect to my smart TV, but purchased without Alexa capability independently, but could not find anything in my price range. So, I decided to purchase this product and am very happy with it. Since my installation, I have added a Dot for my bathroom and gotten plugs, switches and s light bulb that operate through Alexa. I am retired and live in 300 sq. ft.; so, is a smart home necessary? No. But it is so fun to set up routines for lamps and fixtures, as well as provide me with access to a wide range of music through Amazon Prime and streaming through Tune In that I don’t own; I was already a Prime member, so I am paying no more than I was monthly for far more functionality. It also looks great (heather grey) and provides amazingly good sound.  I recommend people use Alexa to begin setting up a smart home and taking advantage of today’s technology.\\r\\n            ', 'I had the echo dot for about a month.

Finding it already great for reminders as I don\\'t have to boot up my computer to create schedules. Search the internet and you will find a lot of Alexa skills. Right now I am listening to Amazon Prime for movie music.Here is an update on two features I really like1) Great Bluetooth speaker for the Amazon Firestick. (My tv speakers are not the best)2) Discovered how to use the SMS to cell phones  (text messaging feature).

I love listening to music almost 24/7 and my single dorm room certainly feels lonely without her filling it up with music. I\\'ve also gotten to discover that nature sounds are a great way to fall asleep! If I can\\'t find something to cook, my Alexa can be there with a suggestion. Truly, she is a wonderful personal assistant/companion. However...A few months into using her (estimated about 4-5 months) she started confusing my speech more and more. She plays things or opens apps that are nowhere near what I\\'ve said. I have to repeat what I\\'ve said slower and louder, usually once or twice more, to get her to do what I want. She will also sometimes not resume my music, responding with \"sorry, I don\\'t know that one\" or simply just not producing sound (my Spotify will say music is playing but she will not sound). I have a number of solutions for this one, including pausing and playing again or changing the song, but the last case scenario of unplugging her and replugging her in has always worked. The device also has a recurring issue of renaming itself AEORD on my Spotify even if the Alexa app says her name is set to what I set it to. Renaming the device and naming it again to what it was in the Alexa app fixes the issue but I have not yet been able to pin down what causes it nor a permanent solution.  She will also sometimes keep her yellow notification light on even if she\\'s read my notifications and I have to have her delete all my notifications to get rid of it.Surely, these are little issues and have happened a total of <10 times in the nearly 8 months I have had her. They don\\'t detriment to my listening or entertainment experience much but would be nice bugs/issues to have fixed.Overall, I still really love my Echo because the sound is fantastic (loud and quality), I don\\'t have to listen to songs I don\\'t want to even if my hands are busy, and she keeps the room alive with sound. I also really love that she adapts her sound to the room in order to fill it fully with a proper sound level.I got mine on sale for $80 but even $100 is a very good price for this smart speaker. I hope I can continue using her for years to come with little complaints as I have so far.(Lastly, if you\\'re one of those knuckleheads who\\'s against Echos because of it \"recording you\" or whatever, your phones and computers have had microphones and constant internet access for years)\\r\\n            ', 'I come in the dark house with 2 hands full of groceries. \"Computer turn on the lights\" and darkness is gone without putting anything down using smart home devices with the EchoThe sound quality for music, paired tv, paired phone, etc is very nice and richly full rounded.

The Echo is so amazing, I can shop with it, set timers/alarms, look up stuff, do workouts, listen to the news, music and books. Have it do ridiculous cat meows to weird out my cats and drop in to my other echo devices in other rooms. I can do all of this by just talking and not pressing a button or tapping a screen. So in that regard yeah I’m becoming a bit more lazy but it certainly makes my life easier.It’s not without its issues though. Despite setting up separate voice profiles it doesn’t always differentiate between music or news preferences among different users. It can’t pronounce my name, can’t look up specific how tos & you have to be very specific on asking it to do specific skills. The Alexa app can also do with some improvement. The drop in feature on the app comes across as a bit complicated among others.The speaker part is superb compared to my echo dots & I can hear it very well throughout the living room & kitchen. It knows when it’s being spoken to vs the echo dots in other rooms that are close by.

I can say, without a doubt, these sound much better than the first gen. Considerably so. There's no doubt in my mind... this isn't a placebo effect. The newer model sounds fantastic.The sound signature is perfect. The vocals are clear, the highs are bright without being sibilant and the bass has been significantly improved. I've actually had to turn the volume down at times because I worry my neighbors (in the conjoined townhouse) might actually be able to hear the bass. This wasn't something I ever did with the previous version. Now, I keep the volume at 5 when listening to music.My reason for giving it 4 stars only is because Alexa is still a headache at times. I don't wanna aggravate anyone with a huge wall of text listing all my qualms with Alexa, but there are a lot of little bugs and nuisances that have yet to be worked out.

Morning alarms synced with home lights turn on / off, news functionality, and music capabilities still impress me till date. It is something I have gotten used to and I really feel odd when I am traveling and have to stay at hotels - makes you kind of miss Alexa and how so many things can be done by just asking Alexa. That being said, as many other reviews mention, its very, very easy to get used to Alexa and Echo. Best purchase I made from Amazon ever.#Initial Review: Feb 27, 2018Initially I was a bit hesitant in spending this much money on a smart speaker device, but when I saw it at someone\\'s house and just how responsive and intelligent its answers were - I couldn\\'t resist buying it. I have had it for a few days now, and I have to say its unbelievably good! At the very least, you get a great speaker - the audio (both treble and bass) is phenomenally good - although I have to give a disclaimer - it does really well in a small/medium sized room, but I am not sure of how good the acoustics would be for large rooms or open spaces.Alexa: Aside from being a fantastic speaker to play your music, there is Alexa (now it starts to get exciting!). As a lot of other reviews have mentioned, it can do many things. My personal favorite is the alarm functionality in the morning and that I can just tell Alexa to snooze for 5 minutes, or set it up to play a specific genre of music for the alarm. Also, the news summary is a great way to start the day, which can be easily had by just asking Alexa - whats the news? It can do a lot of standard functions that the smart assistants on phones do - such as call / text/ set a reminder, etc. The game feature (you can play games like jeopardy, song quizz, etc) is fun, and the microphone is really good - such that it can even hear me whisper \"Alexa\" when I am near the device, and even when the TV is loud, you don\\'t have to scream to call Alexa.Other functionalities: Pairing with other Alexa enabled devices such as light bulbs, switches, and other smart home devices. I haven\\'t tried it, but really curious and would probably be getting some of them in the near future.Bonus Feature (this is really amazing!) : If you are already using the fire stick TV (or are planning to buy one) Alexa works seamlessly across the devices, so you can control your TV with the echo using voice. Its a game changer. You can just ask Alexa to open certain movies or open certain apps, and its that easy. Watching Prime videos is such a breeze, such that you can start a movie, pause, fast forward, or rewind by just asking Alexa on the echo.\\r\\n            ', 'Where to begin? First off the sound on this speaker is impressive considering how little it is and how cheap it is. The sound fills my apartment nicely. Is it an audiophile’s dream come true? Probably not. It is, however perfect for listening to music and works well with Sirius XM, Tunein, iHeart Radio, and other streaming services.You can also have some fun with this speaker. Bored? You can play 21 questions, Jeopardy, music trivia, etc. You can also get flash news briefs and local weather all designed to fit into a nice bite sized piece. I listen to them when I get ready for work.There are some cons, but these are fairly common with AI assistants. Sometimes Alexa doesn’t understand what I’m saying or plays the wrong song. It can get frustrating when I try to listen to a certain station and it keeps playing a song instead.If you have Prime, then Alexa can order stuff for you via voice commands. Alexa also pairs with many smart devices like your lights.The bottom line is that The Echo packs a lot into a smaller speaker. Buy one, you won’t regret it.\\r\\n            ', 'Alexa is in the house. Turn on light (my clever name for the light)? Check. Music? Check. Morning news - BBC or NPR any time? Check. Always on and ready? Check. The sound quality from this heavy little cylinder is shockingly good. There\\'s bass - yes bass. There\\'s stereo sound, yes, thanks to a Bose-like projection of sound off the walls. It\\'s great. I use this as my primary stereo, along with a Tap and Dots in other rooms. Amazon Music calls up whatever I want to hear, and has good play lists as well. I play guitar and music is always on in my house. The sound is great. No, I don\\'t claim to be an audiophile. I\\'m not going to mess around with a vinyl turntable. The ease of playing anything at all throughout the house is revolutionary. Getting up and pushing a button seems barbaric now.The one irritation is Amazon\\'s constantly asking about upgrading to the Amazon Music Family Plan from Amazon Music. Alexa started asking after I linked speakers in a few rooms for music everywhere. Seriously Amazon makes that query over and over again every day. No I don\\'t want it. I\\'m not streaming music in the other room; it\\'s your glitch. I walked over here now. I can walk on legs; sorry about the f-bombs Alexa I know you lack legs.

For you audiophiles out here, no this will not be your music speaker choice. For the rest of us, this is a good music speaker. The speaker is loud and can over-power a room on full volume. A setting of 5 is more than enough for a bedroom.Third, she is not Google. Don't expect her to be. She is a decent 'assistant' with various easy questions like what is 180 ml in ounces or setting timers. She is not going to be able to give you the average winter mean low temperature for Las Vegas. Stop it!Four, I like that the skills are growing almost daily. Meaning that she will be able to do more with each passing day.\\r\\n            \", \"June 2018 - We can no longer listen to music on Alexa because it scares my dog to death. I'm not sure when this started happening, but at some point while listening to music we noticed that she was shaking uncontrollably and obviously stressed. With a little trial and error we figured out Alexa is the culprit; I'm guessing it's a frequency issue. Just the word 'Alexa' sets our dog shaking. This is a shame. Does Amazon plan on fixing this issue?I don't have the technical knowledge of some of the other reviewers. However, I'm a pretty picky person. I bought this for my two teenagers for Christmas and it was a hit the moment it came out of the box. It's very attractive and unobtrusive, and  my daughter set it up in minutes and we were listening to Christmas carols. The sound quality is remarkable for something so small, and the library of songs available with Prime is extensive. There were a few times when Alexa didn't understand us, but 'she' did find a song we wanted from a description rather than the title. All in all, great value for money. I would buy it again, especially as a gift. You get a lot of bang for your buck.\\r\\n            \", \"I wasn't sure if we would really get our money's worth out of this.  This was our first experience with this kind of device. The sound is amazing and worth paying more money than the Echo dot.  The app is also easy to use. Just being able to play any radio station at will makes it worth it, as there are no more fights over the kitchen radio on who changed the station.  It is funny when it hears its name from the TV it does sometimes turn on. I use the recipes feature for the first time last week and found a better way to make hard-boiled eggs and it worked really well. Love the fact you can set up in a daily briefing to get whatever news and/or weather and/or traffic updates while you pour your morning coffee or tea. I do find it does save some time of running back and forth to the computer to look things up. There are many third-party apps you can install to integrate things like games or credit card billing information but I have not done that. You can also set it to mute so it does not listen if you discussing personal information that you do not want your device to hear. I do frequently use and pass on the bad jokes it tells. I can easily see why people buy more than one and put a unit in multiple rooms. Overall we really like our Echo 2.\\r\\n            \", \"The Sandstone White is my third Echo (2nd Gen).  I also have an Echo Show.  I use them regularly in multi-room streaming for music to and from one of my two Onkyo receivers via Bluetooth and to listen to online radio through iHeardRadio.

Specifically, a NetGear AC1200 couldn't maintain multi-room screaming across three Echo's and one Echo Show.  I swapped out the router for my Asus RT-AC66U and all of sudden, everything worked fine.I have never used the first generation Echo devices.  I didn't feel like they provided decent enough sound quality to buy.  THis is also why I have not purchased any Echo Dot's or Echo Spot's.  When compared to Google Home, the Echo's sound superior in a few ways.  You get more highs and lows while maintaining the clarity of the source.  With Google Home, you get more bass, which still doesn't sound as good or great when listening to EDM compared to the Echo (2nd Gen).\\r\\n            \", \"This is our third echo plus a tap.

Surprisingly, this small unit puts out excellent sound.  I love that the bass in this unit sounds so very good.  When you are playing songs with strong bass, the sound is excellent!  I live in an apartment.  I have had Alexa turn the sound up -- way up.  I could hear this over all of my apartment and stopped increasing the sound level only because I felt the neighbors would be able to hear it and complain (although they are not normally complainers).  I just did not believe the sound could actually be this good.  I have only had this one day so cannot attest to its longevity.  But I am sorry that I waited so long to get one of these.  I highly recommend this product!  Of course, I am still learning all of the other things this unit can do but have been very satisfied so far.  Aside from my hesitancy over the sound, another reason that I had not bought this is that I speak with a strong lisp and some programs have problems understanding what I am saying.

She kept bumping the cell phone up against her chin, and when I talked to her I hear numerous beeps when we are talking like someone was dialing out. She is having trouble holding the cell phone up to her head. I talked my mom in to getting an Amazon Echo as a gift from me. My sister helped to set it up since I am in another state. When you make a call with the Echo, it uses the phone number associated with the cell phone that is on your Amazon account. So I changed that to my mothers cell number. So when she makes a call, it shows up as her cell phone number on the Caller ID. Now all she has to do is say \"Alexa call Greg\", and the Echo dials me up, and anyone in her contact list. She rests comfortably in her easy chair, and she can hear everything I say through the Echo, and I can hear everything my mother says very clearly. She can also ask Alexa to dial any number, that is very helpful as well. This feature alone was well worth the price of buying an Amazon Echo. My mother is learning very quickly all the other skills Alexa is able to do, weather, music, audiobooks, trivia questions, etc. Now that I am able to talk to my mother with ease.I would have to say this is the BEST gadget I have ever bought on Amazon.Attached is a Voice Mail from my mother, and how much she LOVES the Amazon Echo\\r\\n            ', \"I have always resisted buyig into these device's.

We keep this one in living room. I have only a few complaints but nothing major. First is I am a southerner so Alexa has a problem with my familes accent. Quite funny at times but annoying at others. Last is she does have limitations for searching things and that is where Google is better. I have renamed each device  so we will not have multiple devices  answer.

Put one downstairs, and put the other upstairs in the bedroom, of course! We’re really happy to have two, actually. It’s nice to lay in bed and tell Alexa to play music, or tell us the weather, or call someone. And downstairs Alexa is more of a social device and all around helper.One warning for anyone buying: If you are giving this as a gift, be sure to de-register it! We tried to set up the one my son sent first and could not figure out for the life of us why Alexa was playing music from Spotify (we have no Spotify account) and not Pandora, which my husband has and linked in the app—but Alexa kept saying we needed to link the account. It took us an hour (okay, we’re a little older and not the quickest on the planet) to figure out the Echo was registered to son. We were playing music using HIS Spotify account. And he was hearing our music selections during our attempts to get Alexa to work coming out of his Spotify while he was driving home from Christmas in another state. The other Echo, which I had de-registered before having it mailed to us, set up without a hitch. So be sure to de-register to spare confusion!We’re so taken with our Echoes we are looking at adding a few Echo Dots to some of the other rooms in the house.

I bought an Echo on Sunday and got it on the following Wednesday. When I ordered it, it said guaranteed delivery on Tuesday. So it was a day late. No biggie for me. Packaging was nice. Opening the Echo was simple and fancy. I really liked how it was boxed and the process on how it opens for the customer. Set up was simple and to the point. You plug in the Echo. Then download the Alexa app. Step by step instructions are there. I probably had my Echo set up in about 5 min or less. On the app you can communicate with the Echo and set up how you want Alexa to greet you and say goodnight. I do not regret my purchase. Alexa is entertaining and my son enjoys having her make animals sounds and tell jokes. It's nice when there's an answer you want to a question and all you have to do is ask her, instead of grabbing your phone or tablet to look it up. Overall I'm happy with the Echo. I gave it 4 stars because I'm still weary about it listening to you when you're not aware, but like I said, I have nothing to hide. I would recommend for sure. Alexa is pretty cool.

When I first got my Echo the sound was terrible. Now the sound is so good I'm wondering how Amazon stuffed such a big sound in such a small package. I honestly dropped my jaw today when a fairly bass intensive song came on and my Echo tackled it like a much larger sound system. This is a very worthy successor to the first gen Echo.If you were on the fence about whether or not to get this device: Go for it. You won't regret it.(Old Review)I bought this as an upgrade to the Echo Dot which I had for nearly a year, but didn't like the sound it produced. The sound this new Echo produces is much better than the Dot, but nowhere near the sound of the Gen 1 (which I have heard via display units many times). I get the distinct impression that a large reason the sound isn't that good is due to the EQ settings for the speaker. If Amazon can give us control over the EQ in the Alexa app, I think customers could fix a lot of the issues themselves.This Echo also has a few mild glitches at times. The light-ring stutters a bit at times, the unit may be slow to respond to commands, and sometimes a weird pop sound comes from the speaker before/after Alexa talks, usually when asking Alexa to handle an app like Spotify.Of course the unit is brand new so there are bound to be patches. I'm not sending mine back unless Amazon says this first run is defective. It has potential, but it needs improvements.Update:I think my Echo just received an update because the light bar was spinning (though I didn't hear Alexa say anything) and now it sounds like my Echo has some more bass.When I put my hand on the desk next to the Echo while playing music I can feel some vibration. There was nothing before the update. Music is also noticeably more well rounded. Could use a smidge more tweaking, but it is better.Amazon is listening and it's working on our issues. Bumping up to 4 stars for improved sound.\\r\\n            \", 'I bought this to complement the half dozen Echo Dots I bought to achieve multi-room audio. I have a number of Logitech Squeezeboxes, but when Logitech dropped Spotify (huge mistake) that created a problem. My solution was to buy the Dots to get multi-room Spotify, then plug them into the back of the Squeezeboxes via a short 3.5 to 3.5 cable. This was a very good and cheap solution for me. The only problem was that I wound up with two things to plug in, and in the dining room (where I couldn\\'t hide the cables) it looked messy. So, I opted to try the Echo. I read reviews saying that the sound quality wasn\\'t up to much, so I had pretty low expectations, but I was very pleasantly surprised at how good the Echo sounds. Not quite as rich as the Dots plugged into the Squeezeboxes, but good enough. Plus, Echo has tone controls, which the Squeezebox never managed.The multi-room audio works great, by the way. There are some limitations on designating a device to be in more than one group (a \"Premium\" feature, I understand), but that hasn\\'t caused a practical issue. I really think the Echo and Echo Dot are both terrific products and excellent value for money. Bluetooth implementation is solid. I only wish that there was some way of having my collection of speakers connect to my enormous iTunes library, but I think that is a political rather than a technical problem and may never be solved. Fortunately, that\\'s where my Squeezeboxes come into their own, though it means having to fire up my Logitech Media Server, which is sometimes inconvenient.The only thing I don\\'t like is that Amazon dropped the prices right after I bought the Echo and the Echo Dots!!! Any chance of a credit, Amazon?\\r\\n            ', 'Little or no FM radio reception here. Yes I have a collection of Bluetooth speakers but the music selection and the multiple steps to connect and control audio via phone/tablet/PC are a PITA.For years, I was concerned about evesdropping and ignored the Echo phenomena. That said, in a moment of weakness I ordered a Dot and my world changed. I use it in my study with and without paired Bluetooth speakers and I do not have to lift a finger to switch between the output or play anything from SiruisXM to radio stations to digital music collections and more. The very next day I ordered an Echo 2.The living area is another situation. Sure I can pair my phone/tablet to the high-end Sony soundbar to rock the house but yet again, it required multiple steps to do so and control it. Since the SO is mortified by any kind of unapproved music forced upon her, I decided to emply an Echo 2 so that I can quickly start, stop and control radio and unlimited music selections with as little drama as possible from the breakfast table.I can now blabber to Alexa in any tone of voice in order to get the job done. Plus, both the Dot and Echo 2 have hearing that is far better than mine. She responds without error from across a large living area even when music is playing. Damn the reviews but the sound quality is plenty good enough and you can easily connect it to other speakers if you want to host a house or pool party. Dot aside, I really do not understand all the griping about sound quality. I was delighted that the Echo 2 has enough fidelity and volume to satisfy me and annoy the SO. The Echo product family is supremely engineered and one of the best products that I have ever purchased--and there have been too many to count.Disclosure: After Dot, I uploaded my entire digital music collection to Amazon Music. While it is comparably under-featured when compared to other mobile players, it works very well with the Echo products and I can listen to my collection sans zero drama and effort.UPDATE: After nearly a week of listening, it is true that the lower mid-range of some types of music and individual tracks are muddled and Alexa\\'s voice and voice output in general is a tad loud with too much bass. However, I am confident that an update will eventually smooth everything out. That said, I wish equalization was available in the Alexa app in order to tailor the sound for the environment and the type of music. I also found that speaker placement is critical. At first I had it 8\" from the wallls in a corner which caused the bass to boom. I moved it in front of a flat wall and it sounded better. I think that the further away from walls the better in order to accomodate the 360-degree sound. I think that ultimately it would sound the best in a middle of a room but who has power outlets located there (a kitchen island comes to mind)? Finally, I would like auto sound levelling because when my daily briefing switches from staid and bassy NPR to noisy Reuters TV, the volume jumps condsiderably. Nevertheless, I still LOVE this well-designed piece of kit but note that I use it like a radio at mostly lower volumes. Thanks Amaon for bringing back a hands-free radio+ experience for somebody that gets minimal radio reception.\\r\\n            ', '---------------------------UPDATE 11/4/2017---------------------------After all the negative reviews and feedback on the poor sound quality of the 2nd generation Echo it appears that Amazon has taken quick steps to help remedy the issue.  I spoke with an Amazon representative on the phone who confirmed that there has been a software update which is rolling out to Echo devices.  After getting the update my Echo does indeed sound better!  I still wouldn\\'t call it audiophile-quality by any means, but the bass is fuller and the sound is less \"tinny\" overall.To check which software version you have, select \"Settings\" on your Alexa phone app, choose your Echo device, then scroll down the page to where it says \"Device software version.\"  The updated version (as of 11/4/17) is 592452420 (previously it was 592452320).You don\\'t have to do anything to get the update; it will be sent automatically by Amazon.  You may see the indicator light on your Echo will pulse blue as the update is installed.  The representative I spoke with said you may get it more quickly by not using your Echo for several hours.  I hit the mute button on mine and received the update within a few hours.  I\\'m very impressed by Amazon\\'s quick response to this issue!-----------------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW-----------------------------As a very happy owner of three Echo Dots (2nd generation) I was glad to see Amazon release a 2nd generation of the Echo as well.  After using it for several days I can say I\\'m quite pleased with it, and even though it doesn\\'t have any radical new features compared with the 1st Generation Echo or the Echo Dot, there are some notable improvements.  I\\'ll summarize these differences first and then describe the new Echo in a bit more detail.Improvements over the Echo 1st Generation:- More color and texture choices- A swappable outer shell- Ability to output audio to another device or stereo system via Bluetooth or an auxiliary cable- Dolby-powered speakers- Significantly lower price!Differences from the Echo Dot (2nd gen):- Larger size and swappable outer shell (these are probably obvious)- 2 speakers (tweeter and woofer) vs. 1- Power adapter sits flatter against the wall---------------------------Overall appearance---------------------------I purchased the \"Heather Gray Fabric\" version.  The cloth is a polyester woven fabric made up of lighter and darker shades of gray which certainly gives it more visual interest than if it were just a solid, uniform gray.  The neutral color blends in with nearly any decor, and the cloth gives it a softer look which is great for areas of your house where you don\\'t want something that screams \"I\\'m a device!\"In terms of size, the Echo 2nd Generation is almost the same diameter (3.5\") as the 1st Generation Echo (3.3\"), but it is several inches shorter.  To me the original Echo looked like a tower; this shorter version is much less ostentatious.The top of the device is identical to the 2nd Gen Echo Dot: it has four buttons (volume up, volume down, microphone off, and an \"action\" button), a multi-colored light ring around the edge that tells you about the Echo\\'s status, and seven tiny holes below which the microphones sit.A new feature of this Echo is its swappable decorative shell.  Simply press a button on the underside of the device and the shell slides right off, allowing you to replace it with any of the other shells that Amazon sells.  I\\'m not sure how many people will take advantage of this feature given that additional shells are $20-30, but it could be useful if you want to change your Echo\\'s look to match a different location in your home.A final note on appearance: the power adapter for the Echo sits fairly flat against the wall, protruding maybe 1.5\".  By contrast, the Dot\\'s adapter sticks out from the wall 2-3 inches.  The flatter adapter of the Echo is nice if you want to plug it into an outlet that is behind a piece of furniture.--------------------Audio quality--------------------I did a side-by-side comparison of the 1st and 2nd Generation Echos, and despite the new Dolby-powered speakers I did not notice a significant difference in sound quality with either music or spoken text.  I certainly wouldn\\'t call it \"room filling sound\" in any case.  Clarity isn\\'t bad, but bass is nearly non-existent.  However, the real potential improvement in sound quality comes not from the speakers themselves but from a new feature for 2nd Generation Echo devices: using Bluetooth or a 3.5mm auxiliary cable (not included), you can play the audio through a nearby speaker or stereo system.  Yes, this does means you are using two devices to accomplish one thing, but in a sense it\\'s no different than plugging any other sound source into your stereo system.  To be honest, I don\\'t generally think of the Echo primarily as a music playback device anyway other than for very casual listening (but I realize that puts me in a minority... admittedly I\\'m a bit of an audiophile).Compared with the Echo Dot, however, there IS a noticeable difference in sound.  This shouldn\\'t be a surprise given that the Echo has two speakers (a tweeter and a woofer) while the Dot has only one.  To my ear the difference isn\\'t so much in clarity but rather in fullness.  With two speakers and a bit more acoustic \"heft,\" the Echo\\'s sound has more presence than the Dot\\'s, which to me makes it more tolerable to listen to for a period of time.  The difference is even more appreciable with music than with newscasts or other spoken text.-------------------------Voice recognition-------------------------This is one area where I must confess I\\'m disappointed.  Like the 2nd Generation of the Dot, the Echo 2nd Generation uses seven microphones beneath its top surface to recognize voice commands spoken from any direction.  My wife and I both found this Echo to be slightly LESS proficient at detecting our voices and recognizing vocal commands than our Dots are.  We did side-by-side comparisons of the Echo and the Dot in several locations around our house and the Dot was nearly always better at picking up our voices (and yes, we only had one plugged in at a time!).  I\\'m not sure why this would be since both devices use similar technology, but the difference was pretty consistent.  One possible explanation I can think of is this: Both devices have their microphone openings on their top surfaces, effectively pointing upward.  Because the Echo is taller than the Dot, if you put both devices side by side and speak to them from several feet away, your voice will hit the Dot\\'s microphones at a slightly more downward (i.e., direct) angle than the Echo\\'s, which may help the Dot pick up your voice better.  Obviously I\\'m only speculating here, but in support of this theory I have noticed that both devices have difficulty detecting my voice if I speak from below them (for example, if I\\'m sitting on the floor and the device is on a table).-------------------Functionality-------------------The bottom line is that overall functionality -- what the Echo 2nd generation \"does\" -- is nearly identical to the 1st generation Echo and the Dot.  Keep in mind that the Alexa assistant software on which all Echos operate is run on Amazon\\'s cloud, not your individual device.  This means that as Amazon adds features to Alexa they automatically become available on all Echo devices.  So, you can use any of them to:- Stream music via WiFi from multiple sources- Control smart home devices- Make hands-free calls to other Echo devices or phone numbers in North America- Make purchases from your Amazon Prime account- Listen to news feeds, podcasts, etc.- Do anything else in Alexa\\'s ever-growing skill set, such as make shopping lists, set timers/alarms/reminders, play games, tell you your daily schedule, and any other skills Amazon dreams up for Alexa in the future.Personally I have two favorite Alexa skills: the Flash Briefing and the drop-in feature.  The flash briefing is fully customizable daily \"digest\" of news and other information which you can hear any time by asking \"What\\'s my flash briefing?\"  There is a huge list of content you can add to your briefing including news updates, weather forecasts, sports and traffic updates, and educational snippets along with many that are just humorous or entertaining.  Using the Alexa phone app or your Echo account page you can select exactly what content you want in your briefing and in what order you want to hear it.  For example, I configured mine with NPR news, BBC news, the weather, and a word of the day.  I love having an on-demand synopsis of the latest news from my favorite sources.My other favorite feature, \"drop in,\" essentially opens a two-way communication channel between any two Echo devices, sort of like an intercom.  Simply ask Alexa to \"drop in on [the living room, the kitchen...]\" and you are instantly connected.  My wife and I use this feature all the time when we need to communicate from opposite ends of the house.  You can turn drop-in capability on or off for each of your Echo devices individually, and you can also choose whether each device can drop in with ANY Echo device or only those in your own home.[Note that the drop-in feature is NOT the same thing as Alexa\\'s hands-free calling feature.  Hands-free calling allows you to call most phone numbers and Echo devices in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada from your Echo by saying your contact\\'s name or number.  Just like with a phone call, the other person must choose to answer your call before you can communicate.  By contrast, with the drop-in feature communication is instantly established.  For this reason you will probably want to use drop-in only with your closest family and friends, and probably only for certain rooms in your home!] -----------------------------------A few (minor) complaints-----------------------------------Unfortunately the Echo 2nd Gen shares an annoying trait of the Echo Dot: widely varying volume levels within the daily Flash Briefing.  As you listen to the briefing, some components (such as One America News) come through quietly while others (like Fox News) are much louder.  I don\\'t know whether this variability is due to differences in how each component of the feed is produced or whether it has to do with the device itself, but in any case I hoped the phenomenon would be less pronounced with the 2nd Generation Echo than it is with the Dot.  Unfortunately, it is not.  Just be prepared to adjust the volume at the beginning of each segment.Another complaint I have is the inability to listen to certain feeds outside of the Flash Briefing.  One America News is an example here: you can listen to the channel\\'s live feed any time, but you can only hear the channel\\'s \"top stories summary\" as part of your Flash Briefing.  This issue is probably more software than device related, but still, it bugs me.--------------A few tips--------------1) The Echo seems to pick up voices best when placed at or below eye level (i.e., roughly the level from which your voice emits).  Mine has trouble detecting voices coming from below it, so I don\\'t recommend placing this on a high shelf.2) When you select news feeds for your Flash briefing I recommend picking one U.S. source and one international source (I use NPR and BBC - both are excellent).  If you add too many feeds you\\'ll get a lot of overlap and hear the same story several times.3) If you have multiple Echo devices in your home, sometimes speaking to one will cause others to respond as well, especially if they are in close proximity (like in adjacent rooms).  One way to prevent this is to change the wake word of one of the devices to \"Echo\" or \"Amazon.\"  The only downside is that you then have to remember which wake word you assigned to each device!4) Some speakers have a bit of a \"burn-in\" period, so in an attempt to improve my Echo\\'s sound I left it playing music for much of the first few days I had it.  The sound did seem to improve a LITTLE, (the lower frequencies filled in some), but it\\'s still not stellar.  But if you\\'re not happy with the sound at first, let it play frequently for a few days and it may improve a bit.--------------------------Which one to buy?--------------------------If you are trying to decide between the Echo and the Dot, think carefully about how you plan to use the device.  The single biggest practical difference between the two is that the Echo has fuller, better quality sound.  So if you plan to use the device mostly for listening to music, news, podcasts, or whatever, you will probably appreciate the Echo\\'s better acoustics.  On the other hand, if you want to use it mainly for voice control of smart home devices, the Dot is more than sufficient.  I have a Dot in our home theater room that I use exclusively to control the lights in that room.  For that type of single-purpose application anything more than a Dot would be overkill.==========Bottom line==========Although the Echo 2nd generation may not have any earth-shattering new features compared with the 1st generation, its significantly lower price and ability to send music to another speaker or stereo system make it a winner.  If you already own a 1st generation Echo there probably isn\\'t a compelling reason to upgrade because the difference in sound quality isn\\'t significant.  But if this is your first Echo device you will probably be very pleased with it.  And if you are deciding between the Echo and the Dot, which one you purchase comes down to how you want to use the device.  For heavy listening, the Echo may be preferable for its better acoustics; otherwise, the Dot is a great deal -- especially at half the price of the Echo!\\r\\n            ', 'Alexa does so much more than answer questions. We have her programmed to keep us on track all morning and evening by playing our favorite music when it\\'s time to get up, tell us when it\\'s time to make breakfast, get dressed, 10 minutes before the bus, dinnertime, homework time, time to turn off our devices, etc. She gives me the news and Daily Show briefings, and she even plays 5-minute workouts and gives me water reminders hourly throughout the day. With some tweaks (wish list below) I know she\\'ll be able to do so much more for us in the coming years, and I\\'m not sure what we ever did without her. My kid hasn\\'t missed the bus all year - and he used to miss it almost every day.Improvements I\\'d make:1. I wish I didn\\'t have to memorize exactly how to request things in order to make them happen; I had to get an Echo Dot to sit beside the bigger Alexa and give her the right commands when I say a briefer one (eg, when I say \"Echo, Goodnight\" it triggers the Dot to say \"Alexa, play Brook Sounds for 1 hour. Alexa, tell ADT to lock the doors. Alexa, turn off Hulu.\"2. I wish we could launch a skill using a time of day. For example, at 2pm I want Alexa to play my 5-minute workout, but so far the only skills you can run by the clock are speaking programmable sentences and playing the news. Otherwise, you have to speak the command. My workaround is that I at 2pm I have the Dot programmed to say \"Alexa, open 5-minute workout.\"3. I wish there were an Alexa app for the PC. It\\'s a pain to use the phone to program all those routines throughout the day, some of which involve a lot of typing.4. On the Alexa app, I wish the routines could be labeled, and enabled/disabled toggled from the Routines screen. They\\'re all listed by time of day, and I have over 50 commands programmed throughout the day, and I have no idea which ones are at which times - they only say 5:00, 6:15, etc. I\\'d like to be able to label them \"lunch,\" \"workout,\" \"brush teeth\" etc so I can find them easily to change the times, volumes, etc.I can\\'t wait for these improvements!\\r\\n            ', 'OK, I\\'m a total Apple fan boy and resisted buying an Echo for the longest time.

I\\'ve even written a small Skill for her!  My wife took some time to warm up to her and thought she was \"creepy\" at first, but now she\\'s asking her questions.  Last night we were watching TV and a question came up and rather than reach for my iPhone I simply asked Alexa and she had the answer immediately.  At a family reunion this Summer my younger cousins were sitting around the Echo playing 20 questions when I came in and said \"Alexa, turn on the kitchen lights!\" and she replied \"OK!\" . . . you would have thought Jesus had just arrived to the party! My cousins started shouting commands to Alexa to figure out what other things I had taught her . . .

I recently replaced the dot with a 2nd Generation Echo - and no longer find the need to use the stereo unit - this little speaker provides satisfying, room filling sound without the complication or clutter!  The unit is marvelously reliable, understands every word that I or my visitors say - she answers every question!I do miss the stereo configuration that my old system provided, so I’ll probably end up with a second Echo to restore the stereo mix, but for now it is working just fine.  My Echo is the device in my house that gets the most use!\\r\\n            ', 'There was a time where if you had told me that I would buy a speaker that essentially listens to everything that goes on in my private living space, I would have laughed and said not gonna happen.I was late to the Alexa party, but I gotta say, it\\'s definitely improved my life in a variety of different ways.Firstly, I\\'m constantly listening to music.  As a Spotify premium subscriber, I\\'ve tried many different blue tooth speakers to be able to listen to music whenever I want.  I always found them to be acceptable after doing my research, however they always seemed limited.  For one, I connected them to my phone to be able to stream.  That meant once I got a call, bam music\\'s done and I sometimes had the person\\'s voice come through the speaker until I switched outputs on the phone manually.  I never even imagined another way.What the most useful feature for this is the dictation.  I can now simply address Alexa and command her to play whatever artist, album, song, podcast or playlist (when you follow them).  This had drastically changed the way I listen to music and I find myself using my Spotify premium even more, getting my $10 dollars worth 10 times over.In terms of quality, I listen to mainly metal/djent/rock and classical.  I don\\'t find any aspect of the speaker to be severely lacking.  Is it a Bose quality speaker?  No.  Does it get the job done with decent registers on bass, mids, and highs?  Definitely.  I mean, I\\'m an audiophile, and while if this was simply a Bluetooth speaker, I wouldn\\'t have went for it just to play music....  However, coupled with the dictation feature, it\\'s a great value.As you can tell, I primarily use my echo to stream music.  However, Alexa has a lot of other practical uses.  Need to remind yourself of something?  Ask Alexa.  Need to set a timer to check on a pot of boiling water?  Ask Alexa.  It truly is a time saving and life improving device.At some point I\\'m assuming these devices will be refreshed, as this is the second generation.  Maybe sound quality will be better, maybe the hub will be included in the base model next time (the real difference between this and the echo +).  That being said, if you are trying to use Alexa to control your smart home, you may want to invest in the plus.  Not all smart home devices are going to work without a hub, light bulbs especially.  Instead of investing in a hub and having two separate devices, might as well let convergence show it\\'s worth and go with the plus.  It could be a deal breaker for some and hopefully you\\'ve done your research up until this point.  I know a lot of things say,\"Alexa enabled\" but sometimes those statements have a caveat.  This is why, the hub.In closing, the echo is a great little quality of life improving device.  If you find yourself looking up what times the gym closes, or getting frustrated with the user experience of most Bluetooth speakers where they require more effort to change the song than you would like, the echo is for you.  Whether you need the hub or not should be the only deciding factor between the base model and the plus, as from what I\\'ve seen in reviews, the audio quality is on par for both devices.  But in confidence I can say I love my echo and for some reason, I highly doubt Bezos or anyone else for that matter really WANTS to listen in on your home anyways\\r\\n            ', \"I got my Echo 2 this morning, spent about 30 minutes setting it up, and have been listening to music since.The setup involved downloading the Alexa app and then getting the wifi set up for the device.  That part wasn't quite the breeze that the steps indicated but once I figured out to decouple from my home wifi network in order to get the Echo hooked up to the Amazon network, then reconnect everything back to my home network. Once that was done the device worked like a champ.I've used Alexa on my phone, so that was the same.  She is responsive and understands my requests.  The quality of the sound is good, the tonal range is reasonable and for my requirements I'm extremely pleased with the sound quality.So it's a good buy, and I would recommend it.\\r\\n            \", \"My wife has an Echo for the kitchen and a Dot for the bedroom and has been 'suggesting' that I should have one in my office downstairs for a while now.

But she was looking for a 'big' item to give me for xmas, so I suggested that would be a good idea...since I didn't think I would buy one for myself.Now that I have it, I have to say that I AM really enjoying it.  I like that I can set reminders easily and quickly.  The drop-in feature is neat because I can't usually hear anyone when they try to yell down to me, but the drop-in works like an intercom that I can hear.  Just starting to explore Amazon Music, so getting used to that.  I still prefer CD's for a number of reasons, but it is much handier and really nice during the holidays to just play random xmas music.  And I have found I really like being able to call up my favorite radio stations just by asking, which is something I've not had for a long time since I don't get radio reception downstairs.  We're having trouble getting the devices all to group together to play the same music, but only really need to during the holidays or a party so not a deal-breaker.  I think the issue there is that the 2 devices upstairs are on my wife's account and the device downstairs is on mine.

Because it is the new toy in the house we've been asking lots if questions and only once Alexa has replied she...it did not know the answer. I think after a while, after I learn all the features echo has to offer, I will be able to write a better review. I do reccomend others to get one.

Fail!I decided to pop up my android phone and ask google what time does the specific game come on and google came back on the first try with the correct game, and even the score.It just goes to show you have to know what you want from a device like this. Although the voice assistant isn't as good as google, I have experience with amazon hardware versus google hardware. Amazon is usually rock solid stable, versus google's perpetual beta system. Google also has a tendency to kill things, and while I wouldn't put that past Amazon, its highly unlikely that they will kill off Alexa. Amazon also innovates a lot quicker than Google (and others) when it comes to these things. They invented this space after all. How long will it take others just to come out with a buggy video version, and amazon already has about 3 producs with it (spot, echo look, and echo show).Either way, if you're home automation focused, I'd go amazon because it has more support and is probably going to come out with more innovative ideas. If you want something you can talk to like an assistant, probably best to look elsewhere.\\r\\n            \", 'My wife purchased one of the first echos on the market, back when it had zero functionality. Back then, I asked, \"What will you use this thing for? It doesn\\'t do anything!\" And it didn\\'t. For years. We would use it to play music for our dogs occasionally.But the times have changed. We updated several features of our home to be a smart-home and used Alexa/Echo to help us. We put her older model in the bedroom, which has better sound quality, and this one in the living room, since it looks nicer.It serves its purpose well enough. We run into bugs occasionally, and we haven\\'t quite figured out placing or accepting calls to family members who have echos - the procedure is a little wonky - but we like being able to access certain features of our home using the Echo.One grip I have is that it will randomly activate and ask a question, usually when watching television or a movie, but sometimes I\\'ll be reading in complete silence and it will do this.\\r\\n            ', \"This is a terrific product and a very good value. The sound is excellent. Of course it can't keep up with high end speakers, but it was never meant to do that. I have a couple of these as well as four Echo Dots. I use them all the time to add items to various lists (groceries, etc.) that then show up on my phone when I'm, out shopping. Great feature. I ask it all kinds of questions and she is very responsive. I play a news podcast every morning. I can ask her what's on my calendar and she will tell me. I also use her to turn lights on and off. But I mostly use her for music. I use Amazon music for this as it does not work with iTunes. Alexa will occasionally fail to understand what you are saying to her, which can be frustrating, but voice recognition has not been perfected. However, this rarely happens and, as a baby boomer, the level of technology is, in my opinion, quite remarkable.One problem arises from the multi-room music feature. First, you can put each Echo in only one grouping. Sometimes I want the music playing throughout the house while other times I just want it to play downstairs. The app will not allow me to put the same device in two different groups. Second, and this is the most frustrating, the music will often just stop playing when it is playing in more than one room. I spoke with Amazon about this and they said they are aware of the problem and are working on an update for this.One other minor issue. She wakes up when you say her name (you have a few choices here). Sometimes she will hear her name and wake up when you are just having a normal conversation or when watching the TV. She'll even do this when a word is spoken that is close to her name. She is very sensitive and she'll respond when you speak in a normal voice.\\r\\n            \", 'Even though I am the ultimate tech geek and tend to buy whatever the latest in consumer electronics, I have been skeptical about the Amazon Echo ever since it was released. Why buy one of these when you have your well-established Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant -- which have been around for years. Moreover, why should I complicate my life with yet another set of unique communication protocols?Well, when I was offered a substantial discount through Audible, I decided to give Echo a try.With the first couple hours of interacting with Alexa, I had my epiphany. Alexa trumps the other interactive technologies in big audacious ways:1) The fact that it is always on and listening makes a huge difference. No buttons need to be pressed. Yes, you might say that you can do that with Siri. But there is a huge difference. Where it trumps \"Hey Siri\" is its listening technology when enables to me to say \"Alexa\" from across the room, when music is playing, in the same way I would call out the name of someone in my family. Believe me...this makes a huge difference in the user experience.Moreover, Siri is impatient and often misinterprets what you\\'re saying. Alexa is right on the money I\\'d say around 90% of the time.2) The skills that come standard are pretty much in line with what the other voice assistants have. And...while there are a lot useless 3rd party skills, if you do your homework, you will find some solid gems by browsing for \"best Skills lists have been compiled by various websites.\"3) If you love music, you are in for a treat. The speaker is awesome, given the size of this cylinder. Initially, I paired it with a humongous Bluetooth speaker I own. However, now I mostly use the Echo\\'s built-in speaker. The sound is easily within the realm of \"dedicated mid-sized Bluetooth speakers\" that Amazon sells that you would pay $150 bucks. I love EDM, Jazz, and Metal, but the true measure of how great the speaker is that I also enjoy listening to classical on it as well.Moreover, the kicker is that you just say, \"Alexa play some Bach choral music,\" and she plays it using the music service of your choice. You don\\'t have to open your phone and dig through playlists. The music just plays.If you are wondering if this device is for you, I would say you are coming in at a good time.

This device is by far the best speaker I have purchased. It gets really loud, so I usually keep it on volume 3/10. And even on volume level 3, I can still feel the base shaking my table and floor.- The price! For $99, (most of the time a lot cheaper) you get an amazing speaker, the Alexa AI, and all the power cords and adapters.- Interchangeable Skins. You can buy any skin of your liking for the device and switch it out! While I have been fine with the default skin I bought the device with, it is a very nice option that usually goes unnoticed.- The microphones do a great job hearing me from absurd distances away. Even from a few rooms over, she can hear and respond to me. The 7 speakers on top are placed in a great position to add that pro.- The status LEDs on top are very bright and color accurate! I love all the different colors that Amazon has added to the device to mean different things. Very nice feature other Smart Speakers do not have.Cons:- The buttons on top of the device do not have that great of a click. Sometimes I press the buttons pretty hard because it has barely any travel. You very rarely interact with the buttons, but when you do, it is noticeable. And that is me being nit picky.Overall Thoughts:I am obsessed with this product. I have used this product for 10 months and I use this product daily. I did not know how much of an impact this device would make on my day to day life. It is pretty big. I use it for so many different tasks and music and even jokes. I love this product!Do I recommend this product? 100% Absolutely!Would I buy this product again? Yep!Should you buy this product? I think you definitely should.

(yes, he's a baby, and it helps calm him).You can set reminders (helpful in our household).CONS:The updates seem to hit when I need it to play music. Not sure if there's a setting for that either.The sound when it plays your audible book vs your music is lower for audible (so if you stop playing your audible book, and then the next time you use that speaker for music, it's super loud).The timers are softer sounding than I would like, and I do have it turned up (music plays louder than the timer).\\r\\n            \", \"I have all the Echos from the first one sold originally only to Prime members to both generations of Dots.

Still, it isn't as good as a high quality speaker, so please just have modest expectations.  I also like the wider selection of covers.  Since I have no reason to touch my solid black echos, fingerprints have never been a problem.  However, I do really like the shorter version next to my chair (less chance of cat knocking it over) and the grey fabric looks great.  Instead of stand-out tech, it melds into the background.Many of the features that this Echo has they have added to the other Echos and the 2nd Gen Dot such as multiple alarms and timers.  So, I really appreciate the ability of Amazon to keep improving on what you already have.  Except for ordering ink and certain specials via Alexa, I don't actually order stuff through the unit because typically, I order 3-5 things at once, not just one.If you already have an Echo 1st generation, other than being shorter and having finish options, there is no real improvement in features.

We decided to get the Echo as a replacement after reading reviews when it was on sale for Black Friday, and are so glad we made the plunge. The sound quality and volume is so much better than the Dot/speakers, and does not take up any more room than the Dot by itself. We no longer have to worry about the volume of the Dot and the speaker system, as everything is now self-contained by the Echo.Setup was as simple as any of the other Echo products we've purchased, which is to say extremely easy. In fact, this Echo seemed to connect to our wifi even faster than the Dots would, and didn't encounter any errors while the old ones used to. Better yet, we have freed up a plug since we no longer have to plug in the speakers, and don't have to have the external speakers always powered on, so we're saving electricity.I love the look of the new Echo, with the white fabric case blending in well with our other white furniture. The ability to swap the case means we'll always be able to find something that matches if we ever get new furniture.The Echo has definitely convinced me that the Dot, while great for starting out, shouldn't be the end of the line for our smart speakers.

I really hope there is a software fix because if not I am returning the unit.\\r\\n            ', 'New Echo is pretty much like the old echo. It is fun and interesting. We have a large family & big house so we gave an Echo to each kid and we can use the \"Drop in\" feature to communicate like an intercom. \"Hey kid, come down to dinner!\" and this works well. In general we use it mostly for music although the sound is just so so. It is not intended to be premium sound quality and it is not. If you want great sound quality look elsewhere. Please note that with a large family, you will need Unlimited Music service as Amazon has gotten very greedy with the prime music service. You can only play Prime Music on ONE device at a time now so if you have 4 kids & many Echo\\'s, that means music can only be played on ONE device and not simultaneously on the others. With Prime you can play the same song on ALL devices at the same time if they are all on the same account but this is useless for families. The Unlimited music Family plan is $150 per year for 6 people. So Amazon knows the Echo is the \"hook\" to the $$$ music plan. But we love our music & we feel music is important for the kids so we feel it is worth it. Also, my kids probably listen to the music more thru their phones & headphones on the Amazon Music app than thru the Echo.\\r\\n            ', 'We purchased the 1st Gen Echo as a refurbished unit for $127.00 Nov 9th 2016. Could not tell it was a referb and we enjoyed it, asking Alexa silly and meaningful questions. We also used the 1st Gen unit for music and enjoyed the fidelity the Echo provided and the Amazon music and Ihart music stations. We would have purchased more units for other rooms had Amazon included multi room music sync.By the time Amazon offered music sync between units word was out that Gen 2 was on its way so we waited.In Dec 2017 we ordered 3 more Echo\\'s, two for the house as gifts for each other and one as a gift for a neighbor. Come Chrismas we were excited to get our new 2nd gen Echo\\'s up and running. It was quite simple to do so and after setting up the Everywhere group via the Alexa app we had 3 rooms playing the same music, now we could have the music through out the house with out it blasting in any one room...nice.The new Echo\\'s were a lot less expensive, even then our refreb Gen 1 Echo, They are a bit shorter and we opted for the grey fabric wrapped on the Gen 2. While I do miss the Gen 1 volume control where you counld just spin the Echo\\'s top left or right to adjust the volume I find the Gen 2 to have the same fidelity with maybe a touch more base. All other features seem equal with the Gen 1 as Amazon keeps updating (automatically over the air) features to the entire line of Amazon Alexa devices.We have now started integrating \"Smart Home\" devices. We started with a couple of the TP plugs Amazon was providing at a greatly reduced price with the Echo purchases in Dec 2017, then I found the Sonoff WiFi switches that can be hardwired into circuits. Now our electric fireplace has a Sonoff inline and we can just say \"Alexa fire place on\" and the lighting system of the fireplace comes on or off when we tell it to. I\\'ve also hard wired Sonoff\\' switches to some of the exterior lighting circuits to control them either with Alexa or the app\\'s timer feature and finally added one to the attic lights where the switch was practically inaccessible, now I just say \"Alexa turn on (off) attic lights\" before I enter the attic and I\\'m no longer stumbling through the pitch black attic looking for the switch.These Sonoff devices are less than $8 each! Its cheaper to use the Sonoff WiFi switches than the cost just in parts and wire to run a new light switch! Home automation is not coming, its here with devices such as the Echo and Sonoff that are scalable, easy to set up, easy to use, work well and are affordable for the average American. Thank you AMAZON for bringing home automation to our home.CON\\'s: Wish Echo\\'s could be grouped on more than one group.  Be sure to indicate any Alexa device your buying from Amazon AS A GIFT if your giving it away, otherwise Amazon sets the device to be on your Alexa network and the gift recipient will end up with your Alexa options and info such as your shopping lists ect until deleted from your account.\\r\\n            ', \"I was about to pack this up to send back, but am fortunate to have checked the reviews first. The recent update made a dramatic improvement in the sound quality. Cheers to Amazon for acting quickly on this. I don't usually post reviews, but essentially wanted to offset some of these negative reviews that may no longer be relevant.So it passed my Jeff Buckley test and may get 5 stars with a little more use and if it passes my wife's Tori Amos test. The form factor and at least equal sound quality to the 1st gen make this a good buy if you liked the original.Updated 12/14/2017: changing to 5 stars after prolonged use.

When I read the reviews I was concerned but un-necessarily so. Within a hour after the connect, I had a announcement of an update and without a doubt the sound is awesome.  While not earthshaking sound, it is more than adequate.  The treble and mids are clear. I can hear the sound of the swipes on the guitar strings and can hear the strum of the bass clearly. The sound is still good at higher volumes as well. We have a Echo gen 1, I like the sound from 2 better because it is fuller. I now have a second generation 2 and plan to add a third.

Easy to set up, great sound, and pretty good at answering questions (my 9-year old really tries to stump Alexa).  My sister called me when she got the package thanking me for it, but stating that she hopes it still works.  It comes in a box but this box was shoved into a padded envelope which was torn and left on my sister's snow-covered front porch.  Temperatures were around 0 last weekend so she had to let it warm out and dry out before she could use it.  Fortunately it all works well.  I think this may say something about the sturdiness of the product as well.  Had this come from a third party seller, I would not have been as surprised as I was knowing it came right from Amazon.  As pricey as these are, you should at least pack it in a sturdy box.\\r\\n            \", \"Bought this for my wife for Christmas. I gave it to her today and this thing is awesome.

No fumbling around with CDs or LPs on the stereo. No more radio stations fading in and out and with static. Wow. The sound quality is good enough for me that I'm seriously considering getting rid of all my stereo equipment and music collection. It's now all there in this little gadget. I've even re-ordered stuff from Amazon through Alexa - so easy.

The sound quality on this thing is phenomenal. And don\\'t get me started on the bass. The beat really does drop with the Echo. The microphone is highly effective. I have tried whispering Alexa from my bed (5 feet away) and she hears me. I also talk to her all the way from the kitchen (mostly for music controls) and the Echo responds accordingly.Now lets talk about Alexa. I have used all the main AI assistants, Google Assistant, Siri and S-voice. Alexa excels where they fail; she has a unique and clear cut personality. Unlike the others, Alexa is super playful so I get the feeling that I am talking to a super enthusiastic assistant, or even a friend. Alexa just feels more human compared to the others. Specifically she has a variety of human-like responses to questions. I just asked her \"Alexa, how are you today\" and she replied \"I came down with the case of the acting bug but I\\'ve got it out of my system for now.\" She was actually \"sick\" the previous days and even coughed yesterday. I\\'m glad she is fine now.I also love her many skills, especially Playing the Millionaire game and the Magic Door. You also need to try her many Easter Eggs. She replied to numerous movie lines such as \"Are these the droids you are looking for and \"say hello to my little friend.\" Lastly, if you haven\\'t tried it ask your Echo (or future Echo) to sing. You will not be disappointed.\\r\\n            ', 'We got the Echo (2nd gen), plus we have the 1st generation, and in the right room/space, the new one\\'s sound is perfectly acceptable, and we are always trying for better sound at reasonable prices. Echo 2 doesn\\'t compare to \"higher-end\" devices/music setups/speakers, (and that\\'s not a claim from Amazon). It\\'s good...good enough not to be distracted by the quality of the sound. We own extreme music components and still have no problem with the sound of Echo 2 because it\\'s very good sound for what it is. What we did have a major problem with was setting up our the Echo (2nd Gen), following the same directions multiple times. I use a LOT of tech with no problem. The setup of an Echo could/should be easier and less ambiguous. Some things in the Alexa App\\'s instructions need to be much more clear about what the next step is. It may have just been connection problems, but it wasn\\'t until my 5th try that it finally hooked up. That\\'s just crazy.Overall, we like the 2nd gen Echo quite a bit. I gave the device 4 stars (it\\'s really 4.5) because of setup mania and the fact that the sound is better on the 2nd gen, but not A LOT better than the 1st generation. That said, though, $99 is an absolute steal for the quality of this device.

Speaker sound is pretty good - no complaints and I notice bad audio when I hear it.Wish it did have:1.  Ability to browse like the Google version does.

They can do this by certifying any software that may be required by the items they offer for sale as being safe from damage by these threats. They COULD do it as a form of insurance for themselves!All things like Alexa invariably put our modems, routers and things connected at risk!Knowing this, I still intend building my smart home BUT I will do it a little more slowly and conscious of the risks!You might help by just making your concern known to Amazon.\\r\\n            ', '***Update 11/4/17:  I wish I hadn\\'t raised my review to 5 stars yesterday, because I got the firmware update that other reviewers have commented on last night on 2 of my 3 new Echoes (version 592452420), and I\\'d like to be able to bump it up another star now that I have. These speakers sound great for their size, better than the original Echo. And they are definitely a great speaker at the $99 price point (and an even better deal if you get them cheaper). It\\'s unfortunate that these speakers didn\\'t ship with this version of the software. It would have saved Amazon a lot of returns. I\\'m glad I had faith that Amazon would fix it, because they certainly did.***Update 11/3/17: raising my review to 5 stars from 3. The more I listen to the new Echo, the more I like the sound when playing music (perhaps my ears are just getting habituated to them? Perhaps, but the sound really does seem to be richer than when they came out of the box). These speakers sound is just very different than the first generation. As you can see from reviews so far, those of us who had the first generation Echo have been unusually harsh, while those who are just buying this Echo as their first full Echo product generally love it. I think it’s all about expectations.—-11/2/17: I purchased the three-pack of the All-new Echo because I wanted to grow my family of Echo products now that Amazon allows for multi-room audio syncing, which already included 3 of the original Echoes as well as an Echo Dot that I have hooked up to the Klipsch 2.1 Promedia speakers via a line-in connection.I think my impression of the new version of the Echo is in line with some reviews I\\'ve read online from some of the tech magazines, which is that the audio quality seems to be a step down from the original Echo rather than an improvement. The instrumental parts of a song get muddied together while the vocals get pushed forward a bit too much, and the bass is much weaker than it is with the original Echo. However, the size and looks of this speaker is a huge improvement over the original Echo (and it actually makes me much more aware of how ugly the grill on the original Echo really is [unfortunately, this had to be preserved on the non-cloth shells of the new Echo).That said, I noticed that the more I listened to one of the new speakers over a few hours, I started to notice that I was appreciating the sounds more. I\\'m not sure if my ear was just habituating to the speaker or if the speaker has a bit of a break-in period. But, when I went back to one of the other new speakers that hasn\\'t been used much, I still noted a difference.I will also say that when I bought my first original Echo, I was likewise not very happy with the sound (and I had similar complaints). Yet, over time, the speaker seemed to sound better, and I eventually decided to buy two more on Prime Day last year. I think that Amazon regularly updates the software on their products, and I believe that they tweaked some of the EQ on the original Echo to make it sound better (however, I can\\'t find any documentation to back that up; I have found the latest Tap update specifically says it was partially made to improve the bass on that speaker).Overall, I\\'d probably give this four stars if the \"improved\" sound hadn\\'t been so hyped, only to see that they sound worse to me. I\\'m still impressed by Alexa and the ease with which I can play pretty much any music I want just by asking for it via Amazon Music Unlimited. I also love the multi-room audio feature. I\\'d love to see the ability to pair two speakers in a stereo mode, but just being able to sync them at all is pretty great for now. I also love the fact that Amazon appears committed to adding useful features, such as the ability to make voice calls with a simple voice prompt, which I\\'ve really appreciated when I\\'m trying to take care of my 8-month old.I will update my review as I use these speakers more, particularly if I notice any improvement in audio quality.\\r\\n            ', \"Small personal info, I wish I had been able to purchase this for my mom before she died.

Began making my first grocery list today. I go to sleep at night with distant thunderstorm ambiance sounds and wake to good morning, coffee started, the weather, and a news briefing. We had company over and picked Alexa's AI brain.  Love the humor they have built into her. I bought one for the den and one for the bedroom.

As I set up the second and third Echos the first unit that had been set up for 10 minutes or so said, \"I\\'m updating, I\\'ll be available shortly\". One by one each speaker received an update from Amazon and I have no idea how but after updating they sound \"AMAZING\" Full, rich base, excellent vocals and overall sounds as good as my JBL or UE Boom.

It is quite remote from the rest of the house, so it deserves it\\'s own Echo.  This is my 6th Echo in a 2,400 sq ft (2 floor) house.  I bought the original Echo two years ago then added 4 Dots to that and now this handsome new Echo.  They all function independently and together (music everywhere !! ... without latency issues).  I probably use all of them for \"smart home\" control (more commands than any other type) of 9 WeMo switches, a Nest thermostat, and a NEXX garage door controller.  I now live alone and it is an extra feeling of security to be able to turn on lights in the house when arriving home after dark.  I have an extra loud doorbell (not WiFi controlled) which I wouldn\\'t be able to hear in this newly remodeled room under any circumstances...so my next smart home addition will likely be a WiFi (Alexa controlled) doorbell (incl. video camera).  My Dots all have accompanying JBL Bluetooth speakers (however, they\\'re hard wired due to the limitation on Bluetooth in a shared network, i.e. \"music everywhere\" only works if speakers are internal or hard wired).  I don\\'t find this to be a big deal.  I\\'m glad that they are Bluetooth speakers for travel purposes, but that is not necessary on a day to day basis.  However, I really like the sound of this new unit...it may be just a touch better than the original \"large\" Echo (both are superb for the intended purpose).  In this new office and for casual listening the internal speaker is plenty good.  If I \"require\" serious listening, I can play the sound through my media system or high-end stereo speakers if necessary.  I also use Alexa for information, stock market reports, flash briefings, frequently for time information when I can\\'t see a clock, and for weather reports.  All of my married children have Dots (which I gave them for Christmas in 2016), so we\\'re going to be working on setting up telephonic connections very soon.  For me Alexa is a voice in an otherwise silent house...a side benefit.  Over these past two years she has acquired many skills, but I\\'m not sure she\\'s any smarter with regard to interpreting my statements to her or wishes of her.

There were a few glitches on the Alexa app but it eventually went through. Fairly easy for a non-techy to connect to a home wifi I think. This is our first Echo and for what it is and is supposed to be, I think Amazon nailed it totally. My biggest concern before my purchase was the sound. It's such a small device, very reasonably priced, and simply could not compete with other devices such as the B and W Zepellin in terms of sound quality. But guess what? It didn't matter. This device is for casual listening while you are working in the kitchen, just lounging in the living room, or wherever. It's supposed to provide background music, not a dedicated listening experience. Despite that you can still plug it into the stereo and have a fuller listening experience, if you want. Or unplug it and bring it wherever in the house you are doing something. You can also stream Apple Music or whatever via Bluetooth on your cellphone so you are not limited to Amazon Music.And did I tell you Alexa works so well?So a bigger device with higher quality components would've given a better experience, but then it'd be more expensive, and harder to lug around. In other words, this is the listening device you are looking for. Amazon put a lot of thought into this little toy.

This Echo made its’ home in my bedroom and after some well thought out routines my bedroom is on auto-pilot.

I ordered it in the gray fabric and it blends perfect into the bedroom décor. The speaker sounds unbelievable for the size and it fills the bedroom with awesome audio.My one request to Amazon would be the grouping policy of the devices. Once you group a device to another device, i.e. I have my Echo in the kitchen and living grouped together to play music simultaneously in both rooms, you can't include them in another group. The times I want music to play synced throughout the house on all devices it can’t be done because devices are only permitted to be in one group at a time.

Sound was a draw as I listened to the same song on each, back to back and while there were subtle differences, it wasn't enough to say one was better than the other, just different....but hold up a minute!!  I checked firmware and it was the same but my testing was interrupted by a notice from Alexa that an update needed to be completed.  I waited....1 minute maybe and it was done.  I started testing again and BOOM, the new Echo wins hands down.  The most noticeable is in the voice/mids which is much richer.  I have a Bose Revolve+ and I'll stop there and just say, the new Echo is really good.  When getting flash briefings etc. the voices are richer and more clear, and Gen 1 isn't bad at all.  For music it's even better, especially since I've had a chance in the last 24 hours to listen to more and different music.So, the new Gen 2 Echo is a winner, and even moreso with the Black Friday Weekend pricing, especially with the TP Link deals, since I have TP Link products, and needed another plug anyway.  Even at the full $99 ($119 for certain finishes) it's well worth it.With it's smaller size, I may replace another Echo Dot with one of these new Echo's.\\r\\n            \", 'While frustrating to use, it is superior to google home.  The most annoying part when playing music is that it trys to upsell subscriptions all the time, every request.  Anyway, Google home is worse and can\\'t perform the tasks as consistently as Alexa re: smart home tasks and wifi speakers, etc.  I think Amazon Alexa will continue to shame Google home as Google\\'s efforts are substantially lacking and the interface is not user friendly.  I definitely enjoy Alexa\\'s ordering capabilities with my Prime Business account, that alone is a gold medal.  4 stars because the radio upselling can make a person crazy, so need to remove that banter and \"if you subscribe\" junk then 5 stars.  At least give us an opt-out setting.\\r\\n            ', 'So it’s been an interesting first few weeks with the Echo and am happy to say Echo 2nd Gen has finally delivered on its promise of improved sound quality over 1st Gen Echo, with the 3rd firmware since launch.  If you are confused about a lot of the negative reviews, old firmware is the likely cause of most of them regarding poor sound quality.Want to keep this short and spare all the gory details, but there was a bug in the launch version of the firmware, which was fixed after a few days, but the first fix, while satisfying some, was not, in my opinion a full fix and left the mid-range frequencies muted and tinny.  Today I noticed that Alexa’s voice in this unit sounded much more like Alexa’s voice on Gen 1 Echo’s I own and, after playing some music, suspected they had upgraded the firmware again, and indeed they have.  The current firmware is 592452720 and it’s a massive improvement over both the original and updated version 592452420.So I decided to do some more side-by-side comparisons with the Gen 1 Echo and can honestly say in many areas the sound quality is now actually better than Gen 1 Echo.  This is how the product should have sounded at launch! If I have any complaints at this point it’s that the low-frequencies loudness could stand to be bumped up just a tad.  (Better yet, PLEASE add an EQ feature to the Alexa app so users can adjust EQ for the room and music type they prefer).  I did my comparisons at volume level 8.  Anything above that and Gen 1 Echo dynamic range starts to break down, while Gen 2 maintains quality but doesn’t get quite as loud and Gen 1.  It’s the right trade off, I would rather it sound good than be louder and sound harsh.  At that volume level I went thru a range of music, streamed over Bluetooth, switching between Gen 1 and Gen 2 devices, and found Gen 2 to be an improvement over Gen 1 for the vast majority of the music I tried.  I’m impressed with the quality of the audio coming out of this form factor, and impressed how quickly Amazon has responded to feedback on the problems. Kudos, this Echo is a keeper.\\r\\n            ', \"The Alexa Hardware (especially the 2nd and 3rd Gen devices) are amazing things.  Whether a Dot or Echo or Plus, the Microphone Array works as expected from even a room away.  The Speakers on the Echo and Plus  (2nd Gen) are Loud and Clear.  The Devices have WiFi and Bluetooth and Aux Port - connectivity abounds.The Alexa Software Environment still has much room to grow.  Ask her to tell you a Joke or some other Cheesy Pre-Canned Line and Alexa will entertain you.  Ask her how to setup your Alexa, and she will usually tell you she doesn't know.  Ask her to use a PIN to complete the Pairing process, and she CAN'T even though she can well understand your instructions and your PIN Value.  Ask her to play music from your PC DLNA or iTunes or NAS located on the same Home Network, and she can't unless you expose those resources to the Internet for connectivity through Amazon's AWS Cloud.  And don't expect Alexa to understand and navigate all of the features of your Amazon Account - Amazon Household is only supported in pieces; she can't handle an Audible Account unless it has an Amazon Account Login; and when you want to play Your Music she will often default to iHeartRadio or try to push an Amazon Music Unlimited Account.

After the last update, Google Home couldn’t find my light switches. After spending an hour with support, it couldn’t find Pandora. I don’t know what else it couldn’t find. I had given up, at that point.Three days later, Google Support called to say they were still working on a “fix”. Except, two days later, I already had one: Alexa.I don’t get nearly as many excuses from Alexa as to why she can’t meet my expectations. She’s also programmable to a certain extent in “Routines” so that one command serves multiple functions. She’s extremely versatile, flexible, accomodating....  And she can find my Honeywell thermostat which Google never could.The speaker system is lacking the base tones of Google Home, although it’s still very adequate.

Just Wow!  I bought one of the very first -- by invitation only -- Amazon Echo devices and have since bought numerous Echoes and Echo Dots for my own family as well as for gifts.  All have impressed.  Still, the sound quality on this more compact, more attractive 2nd generation device is considerably better than the sound on the 1st generation, which was already impressive.  The bass is very strong, almost inexplicably strong when I realize that it is coming from such a compact device, and the treble is crisp and strong.  Amazon has done away with the included remote and has replaced the earlier volume twist ring with simple volume up/down buttons.  This change isn\\'t really a loss, however:  While I liked the upscale feel of the old volume ring, generally, I adjust volume with my voice, not my fingers (\"Alexa, turn it up!\").  My new goal is to replace all of my first generation Echoes and every Echo Dot with one of these awesome 2nd generation devices.\\r\\n            ', 'Just received my Echo 2G yesterday and can’t be more pleased. I plugged it in, set it up through the app and it came to life and is working flawlessly! 3 days before I received a new Echo Dot 2G and became very frustrated because it constantly lost its Wifi connection. After numerous router setting changes, relocating the router, setting up a range extender and directing the Wifi through that, I gave up and returned the Dot. No such issues with the Echo.While admittedly not an audiophile, I found the sound quality to be first rate. Amazon Music and iHeart sound fantastic through the Echo’s built-in speakers and of course you always have the option of connecting via Bluetooth or cable to your favorite speaker system. Calls made through the Echo have gone through without a hitch. Call quality is, in my opinion, is acceptable but not outstanding. The person on the other end sounds slightly muffled and to them I sound like I’ in a large room, which I am but I would expect more from the noise canceling microphones on the Echo. Now, that said, it needs to be mentioned that calls do not go through your phone but through a VOIP system and because of that call sound quality cannot be expected to match the audio capabilities of the Echo. ‘Nuff said.Voice recognition out of the box is surprisingly good and once you set up your voice profile, it’s virtually flawless.I am very pleased the Echo and would have no problem recommending it to family and friends.\\r\\n            ', 'I had one of the first Amazon echo\\'s when Amazon made customers sign up for a waiting list to be a beta tester. I absolutely loved alexa 1.0 since inception. When I moved, my family loved alexa so much I had to leave my original echo behind. I was anxious to have another Alexa in my new home, so I bought the echo dot. It was disappointing, compared to the full sized echo. I spoke with customer service and they eventually gave me a free upgrade from the echo dot to the full size echo 2.0.Side note:Amazon echo is much much better than the Google home. The Google home microphone is terrible at picking up it\\'s key phrase of \"Ok Google\" or \"Hey Google.\" Neither of the two amazon echo\\'s i\\'ve owned have ever had this microphone problem.If you are undecided between amazon echo and google home, then I highly recommend the Amazon Echo, it simply performs better in everything. Alexa is just unable to do a google search. However the google home fails to do most of the google searches i request. It was the sole reason i bought a google home, now I completely regret having the google home.\\r\\n            ', 'Great little device to have around the house. Lots of \"skills\" and pretty entertaining. I was shocked about the sound quality out of this speaker,great sound and amazing base for something this size. WIFI set up was a little confusing and difficult at first. \"Alexa\" doesn\\'t work on the app with iphone 7+ and iOS 11.2,when you try to use it the \"We\\'re sorry,Alexa is temporarily unavailable on iOS 11.2.We are working on a fix\" message comes up. Some of the skill tend not work and you have to repeat the command again to work. \"Alexa\" wont hear wont be able to hear you if the music is playing to loud,you\\'ll have to get super close to the mic,but anything under half of volume is not a problem. One of my favorite features is having alexa turn on/connect and off any other bluetooth devices.Having a power chord makes it kind of difficult to put it anywhere in the house,since it needs to be closed to a power outlet, Hoping the future one is battery operated,having it be powerless chord would be the best thing ever!.\\r\\n            ', 'I started with Google Home, it was on sale and I did not want to put so many eggs in one basket. My main interest with the device is music. I hoped to connect my existing bluetooth speakers to the Home and play music in stereo. This proved to be a bit of a challenge and having to shell out more $$ for Chromecast dongles. Google Home does not have an AUX port. All said and done it worked OK but at low volumes, one speaker would cut in and out. Also, the audio cable supplied with the Chromecast is not the best quality. As for saying \"Hey Google\" and asking things  like \"whats the weather forecast\" or \"whats the temperature today\", Google Home did a nice job. The sound is clear and response is quick. Setup of the Google Home was seamless and quick. Since that time, Google sent an update that allows one speaker to pair via Bluetooth with the Home. As a speaker the Home is decent, don\\'t expect powerful bass or earth shattering sound.Enter the Echo Gen 2 - AKA Alexa, which I received as part of a promo offer. The Echo took a lot longer to setup, it would not recognize the WIFI for some reason. After restarting the Echo a 4 times, turning the wifi off and on my phone, moving the phone closer, etc....I finally managed to get the Echo configured. No instructions provided, the device points you back to the App installed on your phone.After getting the Echo setup, i had navigate the App, which is somewhat confusing. Too many things! I wanted to figure out how to connect my bluetooth speakers up. I secretly hoped the Echo could pair with more than one speaker but no such luck. Turns out that the Echo has an AUX port in which you can connect a standard audio cable. Note to Amazon, make the space a tad larger to accommodate better quality cables. Anyhow I finally found the way to connect a speaker either through the AUX port or by bluetooth. My makeshift work around to achieve stereo heaven is as follows: I have one JBL Charge 3 Speaker connected using the AUX port. I then paired the JBL Charge to the 2nd JBL Charge, using JBL\\'s built-in connect feature. Hey it works!! It sounds good, even at lower volume. i am not an audiophile but wanted to take advantage of the sound quality generated by the JBL speakers. I think highly of the Charge 3.  You can use any speaker with the same functionality. I have not tried Echo as a stand alone speaker but other reviews indicate that its not bad.I had been keeping my eyes on the Alexa because of Apple Music integration. i tried Amazon Music through Prime, however when Amazon introduced the Amazon Music subscriptions all my \"free\" songs started to disappear. Using Apple Music is sweet! That was one of the limitations that I had with Google Home, very limited selection of music. Did not want to pay for Spotify or any other services. While many people say that there are issues using Apple Music on the Echo, no shuffle, etc. It seems OK to me, I can \"Hey Alexa play Prince Purple Rain\" and I hear the song in stereo. If you have tons of music saved in your Apple Music or iTunes, you can finally enjoy it through the Echo. Otherwise asking Alexa about the weather, time, etc is fine.Google Home and the Echo have their pros and cons. Amazon\\'s integration is more mature, however I am sure Google with catch up. I have the Echo placed on the lower shelf in a corner book case, connected to an external speaker which is just one shelf above. I feel like the Echo cannot hear when I say \"Hey Alexa\" from across the room but that may be a placement issue. I can see quite a few advantages of this technology, particularly for education.\\r\\n            ', \"I live in a two story home, so my trek upstairs several times a day to my office/TV area encompasses porting my phone, Kindle and Echo (heavy and tall with recharging battery base)  upstairs ..... and then downstairs again.

I used my iPad to \"install\" it (after getting the free Alexa app), and that was it.  No problems.  Sound is fantastic, and even though I bought it mainly for the music, I can see me using it to ask about the weather, how far it is to the nearest Domino\\'s pizza, and how late does my local grocery stay open.  If you like to listen to music and ask general questions, this is fantastic.  If you are really interested, you can do all kinds of other stuff with it.  I think I will keep it simple.

Google device cannot do any of this currently.  When I say, \"Hey Google\", all the Android devices and the other Google Home in the house wake up and try to respond, real pain.  I figured the Google Home would be smarter because of the amount of data Google has available to them, not so...  Get a Google Home if you use Google Music Service, otherwise, get an Alexa.

Want a news or stock market update with a minimum of searching?  Done!  But it takes some setting up and getting used to AND some of its functionality is dependent on other devices such as the Phillips Hue Smart Bulbs or the TP-Link Smart Plug (Which was a fabulous steal during the Holiday shopping season at $5 a pop with a \"Dot\"/\"Echo\" purchase.  Great \"Away\" feature on that product to turn light off and on randomly during certain hours you set.)  Also, the only \"free\" music you can enjoy on it, as I see it, is your free Pandora account.  You have to subscribe to Spotify, and, of course, Amazon Prime.  But Pandora is good enough with commercials only occasionally and briefly.  There is so much to do and learn with the Echo and its little sibling \"Dot\", but don\\'t let that intimidate you.  This is certainly the wave of the future.  P.S.

Almost literally a night and day improvement! Really; it appears that my Echo received the update overnight.In my original review, I had compared this Echo to our Echo Dot + VAUX speaker and a friend\\'s 1st generation Echo. While I haven\\'t repeated a side-by-side test with the 1st gen, I again compared it the Echo Dot + VAUX speaker setup and (perhaps unfairly) another Echo Dot paired with a Bose SoundLink Mini II. The Echo now sounds better than the VAUX speaker and, surprisingly, can decently hold its own against the Bose speaker! To my ears, the mids and highs of the Echo are now about as clear as the SoundLink\\'s. It\\'s only outperformed by the Bose on the low end, but that\\'s to be expected when pitted against a speaker that\\'s close to $200. Still - like I mentioned earlier - the bass response on the Echo is now greatly improved and helps to create an overall richer, fuller sound. It\\'s now a respectable smart speaker fit for music enjoyment.Also noteworthy is that its listening capabilities appear to be improved. This Echo can hear you from surprising distances, even if you\\'re not projecting toward it or are speaking from the next room. It\\'s also good at hearing you over pretty loud music. (Unless, of course, it\\'s blaring; then you\\'ll have to scream at it or speak very close to the microphones.)I was SO CLOSE to returning this Echo after being disappointed with audio performance that didn\\'t sound \"improved\" at all.

It has a MUCH better sound over a dot and looks great. I went through the trade-in program for one of my 2nd gen dots and ended up paying about $50, which isn\\'t bad.The bvass booms when she answers your voice, which us one thing I dislike. The bass is great for nusic, but is overbearing sometimes for voice commands. I like that it came with a real adapter, like the 3rd gen dot, rather than the typical usb adapter. It is overall great, and I would trade in my other dot if the 3rd gen dot fit my echo dot ihome, or I would have upgraded to another echo if I didn\\'t have the ihome. I honestly prefer the echo alone over the ihome, but for music, I have nice Bluetooth speakers. So, it isn\\'t a huge deal. I think when I move to a larger place, I\\'ll only buy the larger echo products. The largest one seems unnecessary because real music people will have dedicated speakers. But, the echo speakers are loud enough for general music listening and talking to Alexa across a large room with quality sound. I think the echo dot will become a product only for those who really need a budget device or those who seek as small of a device as possible. Otherwise, the echo is the way to go.Other than the bass \"issue\", I considered taking off a star for general Alexa tasks that I think should be standard and functional but just don\\'t work well YET.

It was a gimmick that I knew I would never use consistently because I don't have the attention span. But after careful consideration I placed my order. I knew I was in for something special when the shipping date changed right before my eyes. It was initially scheduled for the usual 2 day delivery then suddenly the delivery date became same day shipping. Maybe it was a Christmas miracle, or Amazon during what it does best, luring customers in, but I was excited to learn when I got home my new Echo would be waiting for me. And it was! Set up was easy. I'm a geek so apps and such are a breeze. In less than an hour I was setting up alarms and playing my favorite playlists. In the future I will add smart plugs to turn my lights on and off.

And the amazing thing is I don't have Prime music only a Prime account, and I can ask Echo to play a song that most people don't even know about. And it actually plays! And of course it's three times taller than the Amazon Alexa but that's because of the awesome speaker inside. I don't need to buy a stereo. This is fantastic! And it's only second generation because the third generation of echo has not come out yet as far as I know. But I just can't say anything more about how the sound fills my room and just sounds so awesome and like I said the impressive thing is is that I can ask them or it for any song that no one's ever heard of and it plays it. One of my favorite songs is by someone called Jean-Luc Ponty from 1969 who is a violinist. I asked it to play a song called new country, and it actually played it. All the vinyl that I had that got stolen, I can play on this Echo! And for my dad who's from Norway, I asked it to play the Norwegian national anthem, and it actually played and my dad who is 96 was singing along to it, and he actually started tearing up which is sad but he really loved it. And it's nice to see a 96 year old person happy. So once again I thank Amazon for sending this to me and I don't know what else to say I'm just very very happy because I feel like I have a real stereo. I would definitely recommend this!

Same thing with Alexa skills. I can\\'t get them through the Amazon store, but I can get them through the Alexa app. There are more listed on the Amazon store, so for the ones there, I can verbally ask Alexa to enable them.Tammy, the Support Rep, agreed that I should have not had to go through the hoopla that I did. If one knows both Apple and PC computers, one should have suspected this was the problem right away. As I did, but the reps weren\\'t listening to me. She apologized and is going to put in a suggestion that their training be changed.I can\\'t speak to that, but I am satisfied with how Amazon finally stepped up to the plate. I\\'m enjoying her immensely. Many of the skills you can get are bogus, but others are exactly what I\\'ve been needing to help me manuever in the world as I age and things become more difficult. Her \"personality\" (jokes and trivia and such) is an added goodie.

You can also use a bluetooth subwoofer for a stronger bass, but it sounds better when you use both Echos at the same time). In it, I listen to news briefings, podcasts, my Audible books, and relaxing sounds while I read a physical book (or from my Kindle). I also listen to music. A lot. I have Amazon Music, but you can use Spotify or Apple Music if you like. (Yes, you can link your Apple Music account through your Alexa app, but Amazon doesn’t advertise the fact.) I love playing my favorite music while I get ready or when I’m in a cheerful, energetic mood. Downsides? It doesn’t always understand me. I don’t have a heavy accent or speak too quickly, but I often have to repeat things to Alexa. She’s getting better though. Other than that, I love this device. I’m thinking of getting an Echo Show, but not for now. I give Alexa four out of five Coconut Dream Iced Lattes (Mini’s Special!).\\r\\n            ', \"I have this in the kitchen and for it's size and cost the sounds quality is good and has decent base.  The microphone pics up very well from anywhere in the room, like the echo dot 3rd gen which is a massive improvement over the echo dot 2nd gen I have.  The 3 are in different connecting rooms and they are pretty good at knowing which one I am speaking to, even when the blue light illuminates on all three of them.  The Alexa software is fun to play with and ask stupid questions to see what kind of response it will give and is generally good at finding radio stations and playlists to fit whatever mood I am in and like that after setting up will play simultaneously in sync with each other, a lot better than turning on the 3 old receivers where on the same fm radio station they would be out of sync with each other but any of them can easily be connected to the receivers from the aux output to further improve the sound quality.  If you add the battery base for it, it makes a great addition for a backyard party without dealing with power cords for about 5 hours of music around 70% volume which is also great for when doing gardening or other yard work.\\r\\n            \", 'We bought 1st generation years ago and loved it, but for playing music we used our Bose Soundtouch 10. So our kitchen, dining room and bedroom had two speakers taking up space, the Echo and the Bose. Now the New Generation Echo devices with their new speakers are so very good plus so very small that we decided removed our Bose speaker from the dining room. In the kitchen and bedroom, we bought the Echo Shows which they also have great sounding speakers.  We almost bought the Sonos One with Alexa, but after comparing them side by side in a show.  We bought the Amazon Echo devices based on the equally sound and the better price. We paid $69 for the Echo, $99 for Echo Plus and not $199 for the Sonos. The Echo Shows, We paid $179 which was still cheaper than the Sonos One.  Now don’t get us started on the new Bose 500 with Alexa at $399, which barely sound better than the New Generation Echo devices and definitely not worth $300 more.  Remind you we own a lot of Bose products and have been fans since 1980. So my recommendation is buy The New Generation Echo Devices over the over priced and marginally better sound Bose 500 is a based on years of use.\\r\\n            ', 'The Echo 2nd generation is a brilliant piece of technology and for your listening pleasure, and I mean serious listening pleasure, Having bought two of the Echo 2nd Generation, I can have both speakers playing, as an example, the music of Toni Braxton, and living in a small 1 bedroom apartment, the sound is superior. I also have an Echo Dot, which I patched into my receiver and with Amazon Music, the tracks are endless. I was able to sell my entire CD collection which was primarily, a collection of Jazz, and now, most of the music I request from Amazon Music is available and sounds so damn great. With Amazon Fire TV, there is little that I need or want. YouTube has scores of the Buddy Rich Big Band on video and for the most part, the audio is absolutely terrific. I know this reads like an ad for Amazon but I am not related to anyone that remotely works there nor do I have any special interest in the company but I must tell you, that with the advent of Echo 2nd Gen, Echo Dot, a new Yamaha Receiver (TSR 5830) and Amazon Fire TV, I am in another galaxy of pleasure, of audio nirvana. Oh yes, I forgot, 2 new Klipsch Sound Speakers, has made my life a great place to be in.

I control the bedroom light from bed and turn off the family room light from there too. I can lock and unlock my front door via a link between Alexa and my Wink router. Yet another win.

Alexa can here me from an entirely different floor in my house, and I can hear the music on a different floor as well. Maybe those who have played one generation and then the other are noticing a difference, but not me. Additionally, only 20 minutes or so after I first set the echo up, it rebooted saying it required an update. I believe this may be the sound update that some have referred to in their reviews, but I can't be sure of that.

Even with all that,  we still feel like we are only touching the tip of the iceberg of what we could do. However, for us right now, we are very satisfied and happy with each one of these little devices!  In fact, we were so happy with them we gave 3 for gifts to family members and they were thrilled to get them!Suggest every home should have at least one. Also suggest checking into ‘Ask My Buddy’ when you get one. A very nice feature to add to Alexa.

Alexa could not comply with either request....As you likely know, there are many, many \"skills\" for Alexa available, and we are just starting to explore them.

We ordered the echo dot, plugged it in for about 10 minutes, fell in love with it, and ordered one echo tower for dining room, master bedroom and my son's room.

There are some things where you won\\'t quite get an answer to a question you could google. But, sometimes we\\'ll ask Alexa a quick question anyways, especially it we have our phones in another room or are cooking and need to be hands free, and be surprised with a helpful answer. The sound is amazing for music. We would rather play music off the Echo than our tv. We have problems connecting to spotify by voice but we can manually connect to the spotify app and play music via bluetooth. (That\\'s where playlists I\\'ve made are, and sometimes want to mix it up, as Amazon music mostly plays either a specific artist, or a specific genre + time period) There is rarely a problem for us to wake the Echo, even while it\\'s playing loud music. We often have problems waking our first generation Dot, especially when the alarm is going off in the morning. We\\'ll be practically shouting at it to get it to stop ringing. I can see us replacing the Dot with an Echo soon and purchasing a few more Alexa products. If not for us, then for our friends and family.

This skill if say I fell or something is amazing and could be a life saver, I can just hollar out Alexa call ......... and she will connect me. I use it for a timer, oodles of lists that I can just tell her to print, music, my schedule or calendar, games, (jeopardy, akinator), guard dog, on and on, I have just begun.I will say it takes some set up and getting used to saying Alexa, always first , there is a learning curve on how she works and communicates but so worth the 70$ I paid on sale, I already had a prime membership anyway for videos.

I bought a dot during black Friday and once I started using it I bought a second Dot and this Echo while the weekend deals were flying. Such great prices can't be passed up, you know. I love Alexa most of the time, though at times she can be really dumb and annoying. I expect that the issue is with HOW I AM issuing commands and expect that once I get a better understanding of how to communicate with her the experience will only get better. Turning lights on and off with voice command is great and using her to play music and watch tv is the best. I was pretty impressed with how decent the speaker is, much better than I expected for this type of design. Its placement in the room will affect the nature of the sound, I recommend having it about a foot or two from a wall to give a fuller sound. At least that worked for me. In the middle of the room on the coffee table was not great. Of course, YMMV.

The skills available are useful with many targeting control of IOT devices such as thermostats, lights and such. And recently, Amazon added the capability for you to make phone calls and text anyone with a compatible Echo device and/or phone (Android and Apple) using the Echo app. This feature is called \"Drop In\". With it I can call from my Samsung S8 and speak with anyone near the Echo. Or you can call from the Echo by verbally requesting a phone call to anyone in your contact list. Not sure if it will call any number you give it yet but that test is coming up. Finally, I connected the Echo via Bluetooth to my desktop. Now I can bypass the Echo speaker for a much better quality sound when using it, particularly with the Amazon or Pandora music services as my Pc\\'s sound is much better than the Echo itself.

You guessed it - a software update just received and boom, Spotify throughout my apartment.Absolutely pleased with my Echo trio. Any more improvements will only be icing on the cake as the only 2 drawbacks have been corrected.I withheld my review, as early adopters should expect to find issues that will need to be improved upon and hope that the manufacturer will do what is right for the product and consumer.

We call our family and leave stupid voice messanges to friends that have Echos.

I love this speaker, it sounds great, it\\'s easy to set up and looks great, I use it everyday.  Reasons I do not give it a 5 star review; unlike my Tap it\\'s not portable (it must be plugged in since there is not an internal battery), I like to take it outside and room to room without having to unplug, wait for it to start up and resume.  I do see they have portable battery bases but they are $40-$60, so on that aspect I like the Tap better.  Also the listening skills for Alexa on this gen are more sensitive than the tap.  I can be in adjacent rooms and can speak commands and it\\'s easily picked up, but also interferes with an echo dot frequently so I had to change the name of one of them.  I have also had issues with it listening for a command without me saying \"alexa\" so that is disturbing at times.  It might be a voice training issue.  Overall I love this speaker and am would recommend it.\\r\\n            ', 'Pros:Love getting answers to questions, especially mundane things like weather, news, trends, stock tips. I even asked for recommendations on buying a new screensaver for my iphone. It gave me the top three, which I ended up buying one of them, after confirming with my own research. It answers trivia questions, but it takes follow up research sometimes to make sure it’s correct.Cons:I have to speak clearly or end up repeating. It doesn’t know answers to a lot of stuff.  I can’t access a lot of sources I would like, as certain news stations or to have websites read to me.Overall, for not being a techie and resistant to change I’m ok with it. And having a computer that seems like a person in my house that is always listening for my voice is kind of weird. I ended up being ok with it though since it’s very helpful and a true timesaver. I just wish I could change its name to something unique of my choice—when I have the tv on qvc or hsn and the host says “Alexa”, “Echo” or “computer” it answers back, which is both funny and creepy at the same time.I ended up buying a robot vacuum too as I’m caving in to the computers now and they’re making my life easier. They’re not perfect and don’t do things all the time as they’re supposed to, but neither do we!\\r\\n            ', 'Wavering between four and five stars, but opted for five because the detractors were minor compared to the excellent features.  Encountered very few snags when setting up and all worked as advertised straight out of the box.  Extremely sensitive microphones; my wife was talking quietly about Alexa in another room and Alexa woke up asking for prompts when my wife mentioned \"Alexa.\"  I purchased a number of third-party accessories, like wifi light bulbs and switches, all of which connected easily to Alexa/Echo.  After only a few days \"weather\" and \"flash brief\" have become necessities for my morning waking routine.  It will work with my Fire TV, but I experience more glitches there.  Alexa doesn\\'t always recognize movie titles when I speak them, and sometimes does recognize the title but brings up something else.  But it still does well with Fire TV.  Surprisingly it will search and work with other competing networks, like Netflix, which is great.\\r\\n            ', \"This is my second Echo. The first is in my bedroom and this one is in the kitchen. These Echos are handy, more so as I figure out what works for me.I use them to answer questions, though many of the answers are from Wikipedia and not up to date. Still that's okay. The weather reports are better. I can get today, tonight and tomorrow, though it's taken Alexa quite a while to default to where I live and not where she thinks I live. And the timer and alarm features are great. These have proved to be a wonderful asset.So I have to tell you that my Echos get me through my medication, exercise and stretching routines with the timer feature. Here's how I use the Echo: I have to stretch out my calves, for example. I know that the length of time to get to my count is 20 seconds on each calf. So I set the timer over and over for 20 seconds and don't have to count--an activity that drives me nuts. Sometimes I have to do 10 sets of something or other for 5 counts for each. I set the timer for the longer period of time so all I have to do is repeatedly count to 5. I take medicine for pain. Instead of getting all restless waiting for medication to work I set the timer for 25 minutes. By then I should be out of pain. By letting Alexa track the time I'm less anxious and then she reminds me that I'm out of pain. That's a feature that is really helpful. BTW my physical therapist likes my use of Alexa to count out my stretch time. He has recommended to others who also lose count or don't like all the counting.Finally in the kitchen I don't like all the timers on my stove and on the counter so I threw out the counter ones and use the stove ones discriminately. Alexa tracks at least three timer needs simultaneously and even names them. All good to great for me. Now I can track when to add something to the oven, when to check my pot of soup on the stove, and even when to make something in time for dinner.And, yes, I do ask for a song to be played occasionally. But that's a mixed bag like the Wikipedia answers. I can ask for a song and Alexa tells me she can't find or doesn't know it. Don't like that. On the other hand, Bruno Mars is always there waiting.Finally the look of the Echos is hardly worth discussing and asking to change the volume on this 2nd generation Echo is a toss up as to what will happen. But like my first Kindle Fire I'll probably come to love this thing once I've figured out how it works best for me. That of course is the big question.\\r\\n            \", \"had to use pixel xl 3 to do it.

But much like the second generation echo dot, I hate that they lost the turning ring on top for volume.  That is what cost them a star.That used to be such a great, quick way to crank volume either way, and now having to hold buttons just isn't as elegant or quick.  Not to mention you used to be able to see with the ring light just what volume was set to.Functionality just keeps growing.  I have a smart home, so I have many things, from outlets to LED bulbs to appliances and thermostats.  I love being able to control things with voice.  And for things that don't have quite the elegant direct control available, I like the fact that there is IFTTT that can often be leveraged.Too many things aren't in the available music library though for prime members.

Alexa wakes me up every morning.  I can ask her to wake me up to a particular song even.  She (the Echo) plays music for me.  I can ask Alexa for suggestions, and she will provide music based on the type of music that I ask for.

She does tell pretty funny jokes and responds 1,000,000 times better than SIRI or my in-car navigational system.  Alexa will tell me about the weather and traffic in my area.  She even played 20 questions with the kids the other day.  She will repeat things if you say \"Simon say\" first.  The kids have her bark at the dog (make dog noises).Alexa has helped with homework, by asking her to explain or give definitions to things.  I have used Alexa when I am cooking.  She has provided me with recipes, ingredient substitutions, and can be used as a timer.  I can have her give me reminders, shopping lists, etc.  I never thought I would use something like this.  I had an Apple phone, and all I did was get frustrated with Siri and all of its functions.  Alexa is 100% different.  It is user-friendly.  All you have to do is open the box, turn it on, and then do a quick set up.The speaker (Echo) itself, it very nice.  I have had many complements about its looks and how well it plays.  I am extremely satisfied with my purchase.\\r\\n            ', 'Bought this during Prime Day which made it make more sense. Also FireTV.  Both work really well.  I have fiber optic internet which Alexa connects to through wifi, which is still very fast at 20Mbps. Although Alexa seems to lose connection or cut out during certain times of the day when Amazon\\'s servers must be jammed with millions of people all streaming content, it\\'s for now an acceptable annoyance in exchange for being able to say, \"Alexa, what\\'s the Dodgers score?\" or \"Alexa, play Mozart\" and the sound quality of Alexa is surprisingly good (Bose-like in that it really booms out clear, rich sound) My wife and I love it and very happy we bought it.\\r\\n            ', \"I have had the echo 1st generation for quite a while now and love it.

They also were fascinated by what the Echo can do.  The sound is amazing for such a small package and if you have Amazon Prime you have an immense catalog of music to choose from.  I have Prime and my father also has it.  They are 84 years old and have no problem getting Alexa to do what they want.  My father is even talking about getting some plugins for Alexa to control, which I haven't even done yet!  It was also on sale around Christmas time and that made it a no brainer about buying them one!  My father has quite an eclectic taste in music and wanted to listen to some Bluegrass.

I love that I can drop in on the Echo when I am out to say Hi to those at home (or to listen in on them haha!) I love that it can basically be used as a home phone!! We love the fun games we can play! My kids love \"Last one standing\" \"Amazon story time\" My 9 year old is obsessed with Alexa\\'s love song she sings! haha! I love that I can easily add items to my shopping list, I love the game \"Song quiz\" so fun. We love playing music, and that we can get answers to questions with out needing to pull up google on our phones or computers. LOVE this product! Would totally recommend!

Never thought we'd be any kind of 'wired' house, but we are glad to have finally given-in. Whether answering questions, looking things up, or playing music, this Echo and Alexa are great!Be aware: When you add a second Echo, Amazon raises the music library price, even with a Prime membership.

The sound quality is great and filled the room! It's super easy to set up. You plug the speaker in, download the app for your phone or device, connect via your Wi-Fi and you're all set! I downloaded skills like Spanish and Alexa speaks to me and helps me learn spanish!! It's very interactive and fun to play with Alexa, just as you would Siri on the iPhone.

The only reason I didn't rate the 2nd-generation a 5, is because the original Echo has a dial-ring on the unit's top, to manually rotate the volume up or down.....and I like that feature....Otherwise the 2nd-generation unit is a desirable product...I'm glad I bought them!!!\\r\\n            \", \"I have only had my echo a few days and am still figuring it all out, but I'm pleased with what i've seen so far.I'm not extremely technologically advanced, but have been using it to play music. It is set up in my bedroom, which is a larger than average master bedroom. The sound quality is extremely impressive. I can easily hear it even outside of the bedroom in another room. Whether the volume is low or high, the sound quality is not compromised and the bass is excellent. It's much better than playing music from my smart TV, laptop or phone. I also like telling Alexa what genre to play and letting her do the work to decide what song comes next. She keeps streaming great songs, some I haven't heard in a long time and had forgotten about. I also use it for an alarm in the morning. I will try out the reminders and other features in the future.I am still figuring out how to sync it with my phone's bluetooth so I can stream Youtube sometimes. My only complaint is it started talking in the middle of the night last night when I had already put it on 'do not disturb' mode. It scared me right out of the bed! Hope that doesn't keep happening.I am happy with it overall and excited to see what else it can do. But even if you are only using it for music - it's excellent. No need for a fancy home surround system, just a few of these (depending on size of home) should do the trick.\\r\\n            \", \"Can't say I enjoyed the hassle when Amazon delivered my Echo to someone else. It took hours for customer service to admit the mistake after first insisting it was still on the truck despite the notice it had been delivered to my door. Customer service was a train wreck, and I lost track of how many support personnel I  talked with between them losing my Echo and me trying to set it up to actually play my music. But I can't fault the Echo itself. It does what Amazon said it would do. And, it is sure nice laying in bed asking Echo what the time is or what the day's weather will be. Alexa does need some continuing  refinement which I'm sure Amazon will do. Echo sounds great at higher volumes but begi1ns to sound 'tinny' like my first transistor radio at lower volumes. Alexa's writers need to work a bit on their jokes. When I had to explain most of the humor to my grandson, I felt like many of the jokes never really hit their target of actually being funny. I wondered, too, whether I'd started talking in my sleep when one night I was awakened by Alexa playing a piece from my music collection. It hasn't happened since. But it is a stitch when I watch a YouTube video to learn more about using my Echo, Echo responds to commands given in the video demonstrations. Over all, it is a nice piece of technology that I would recommend as a future purchase. When paired with my Prime account, or even better with Music Unlimited, it was a good decision for me  to acquire.\\r\\n            \", 'I got the Echo tower and I don\\'t see the problem - I think it sounds good! I mean, it\\'s not like listening from my stereo but it does have good sound all by its lonesome, nothing like the tin can sounds that comes from a TV. Plus with Music Unlimited I feel my options for listening are endless! The only thing I had trouble with was the initial set-up. All I kept seeing in the instructions was \"just use your Android phone\" but guess what? Not everyone in the world is up with the times. So it did take a while to find the download for connecting my Echo to the internet via computer. You go into your device on Amazon and click on start-up and it\\'s \"hidden\" within one of the paragraphs. I love this Echo! I just don\\'t know how I ever lived without Alexa in my home.

Overall works great and I have recommended the device to others.\\r\\n            ', 'I purchased this Echo so I could check the weather, listen to music, and have some fun with. I saw many reviews saying the bass was not good enough while listening to music. Well, I am 49 years young and have heard the output of many different music players. The first thing I had to do was say \"Alexa, bass down.\". I did this twice and bumped the treble to the max. I then had to bump the volume down. The Echo filled my large study with great sound - even at volume 5. The echo sounded perfect in my opinion.I found the Echo great for quick lookup of word meanings and Bible references. If you spend time in daily Bible devotion you will understand how nice it is not flipping through books and chapters. You can easily use the publisher provided references with ease. The Echo would be a great gift for any Bible student or school student. All the information, for the most part, is just an \"Alexa question\" away. The charcoal fabric cover blends fine with almost any decor (if you\\'re into that).I also had fun programming the Echo with custom skill answers. Now, my wife knows who is the master of the house...thanks to Alexa. LOL. I had her yelling \"Don\\'t listen to him Alexa!\" I will let her know the \"Alexa, stop.\" command one day in the far, far future.The only complaint I have is that customized covers (sports teams, characters, & other types) are $20 each from outside vendors. Mr. Bezos, how about starting an internal department to create and gain license\\'s to manufacture and distribute cosmetic covers and/or sleeves for your Amazon devices. The Echo is a great tool. Let the buyers have an opportunity to dress it up with some personal style at the time of order.Thanks.\\r\\n            ', 'Love love LOVE these devices. They are so helpful in so many ways. Music - The sound is amazing for what it is. If you are expecting concert speaker sound out of a device that has a 2 something\" speaker in it, your delusional. Have a Bose Soundlink Color II and the Echo is comparable. The only thing missing is the deep bass you get with a Bose but that is not to say that it doesn\\'t have good bass. Put in the right location, it sounds amazing. Mine sits in a corner on a mini shelf at about 5\\'6\" off the floor. Ease of use - Alexa, (fill in the blank). It is so easy! And with all the Skills available you can do so many things. Just have to take the time to see what is out there. Smart Home - Have 4 Phillips Hue bulbs in the house and I am hooked! Can\\'t wait to get more smart devices. If you are going to have ten or less then just buy the Echo Plus that has the built in hub otherwise, buy a starter kit that has a \"Bridge\" and control up to 50 devices with Alexa or from your Alexa app from anywhere in the world that you can get service. Routines - An alarm for me that tells me the weather for the day, an alarm for my 6yr old daughter that tells her she is awesome and can do anything she puts her mind to and turns my lights off for me and 10pm and on at 4am for my wife.\\r\\n            ', \"I love love love my echo 2nd generation! I use Alexa constantly. From music, to timers, and alarms all the way to queuing/pausing/playing programs on Netflix and Amazon (fire tv required). Alexa wakes me in the morning and plays me 'ambient sleep sounds' at night. She is great for searches, podcasts, and audible books. Alexa is always learning and actually gets smarter the more you use her. Its incredible. She also has excellent sound quality with deep rich bass and super crisp high end and mid levels. All which are adjustable in the Alexa app, or by voice.Sometimes Alexa has a hard time understanding what you are commanding, but that's seldom. I also recently discovered that if Alexa loses internet (mine was due to my network at home, not Alexa) she will still  sound the alarms you have set.All in all this thing is incredible. I purchased the 'mission shell battery case' for my echo so that I can move Alexa around to any part of the house I want to keep listening, or to mother in laws house to dogsit....i am not disappointed one bit with my purchase. Would most definitely do it again!\\r\\n            \", 'I never thought I would actually use one of these devices - I pretty much always have my smart phone on me. But I upgraded some light switches and dimmers to wi-fi control and bought one of these and a Dot (for another room) simply so I could have voice-command lighting. I loved it so much, I bought a total of 4 Echos and 3 Dots. Instant whole house music, instant home intercom, instant LOTS of things! The Echo has surprisingly great sound for a little speaker. I have one rather close to a TV and unless I mute the TV, it doesn\\'t hear me well, if at all - even if the TV sound is low.The only things I DON\\'T like about these (if you have more than one - especially if you have a lot of them) is that each of them must be programmed individually. It would be nice to be able to increase/decrease the volume of ALL of them by just telling one. Also, setting up \"groups\" could be better. Each individual Echo/Dot can only be part of ONE group. It would be great if I could have a \"Whole House\" group, as well as have a \"Downstairs or Upstairs\" group - I don\\'t understand why that would be a difficult thing to program. From my understanding, it (might?) be possible to do this, but only if you subscribe to the \"Family Music Plan\" or whatever it\\'s called. The other thing that drives me CRAZY is when my husband changes command to his account, doesn\\'t change it back, and then Alexa can\\'t understand any of my macros for Lighting Scenes. It would be great if I could simply copy my entire Smart Home and Skills settings, in whole, to his phone - then we\\'d have the same commands for everything. But no - I say \"Start Night Lighting\" and am told that she doesn\\'t know that one and to get started, go to the blah blah blah (really LONG reply - and I feel rude cutting her off!)! Then I have to ask whose account I\\'m in, switch it, and then repeat the command. There are times Alexa doesn\\'t recognize my voice (yes, I voice trained it) if I\\'m speaking in a slightly higher/lower voice. So it can be frustrating at times!This last thing is REALLY petty - but it would be nice if Amazon started getting humans in the habit of saying \"Please\" and \"Thank you\" to AI. There\\'s no need to rid ourselves of pleasantries to robots and automated devices - we\\'ve already, so many of us anyway, lost the ability to use pleasantries to EACH OTHER!

He often uses his headphones with it for privacy and said today he's no longer bored.  He had originally asked about a WiFI radio but this is so much more!  I would highly recommend this - totally exceeded our expectations.\\r\\n            \", 'I became interested in the Echo when I learned that numerous talk radio stations were available through it.  When QVC had a two-package Echo on sale I decided to make the purchase.  I am somewhat of a \"gadget\" techie person so I was not really concerned with getting them set up.  But that is where I had my first frustration.  I was expecting a step by step User\\'s Guide or something similar, but there was not.  A simple list of what the Echo can or cannot do would be great.  The only thing I found was directions to go to the Amazon site and download the app and follow the instructions there.  That was useless.  I had to start over several times before I was able to find the right combination of actions to get it connected - finally it was.  Then I went to try and learn how to use and get the most out of it and how to use it efficiently.  Learning about the different \"skills\" that the Echo uses was uninformative.  I understand that the Echo is a piece of hardware and that the current state of science is that the Echo has no intelligent understanding of what is intended when issuing a command.  In other words, the Echo does not understand that when I say \"Dining Table\" (which we don\\'t have) I really mean \"Kitchen Table.  I understand that you have to be consistent in your commands to the Echo for you to get the desired results, but when I use a command that worked perfectly before and is not recognized the next time, or the Echo (for one reason or another) decides to go to a different but similar skill app and now will not work is exasperating.  The Alexa app could be a lot more informative on how to set it up and use it.  I guess I get better use and understanding from an item or a system if I have an idea of what I can expect from it before I jump into it.I have had my Echos for a little more than two weeks now and had learned more in their use - I do not regret making the purchase and would recommend it if a buyer who is technologically challenged or either has someone who can help them set and understand how to use, and or has a high frustration tolerance level.

I have the original Echo and it having a hard time hearing me most of the time, it was really big as well, though the speaker was loud it feels like it has no bass at all at high volume.  I decided to give the Amazon Echo 2nd Generation it a try when it was finally marked down to $79.99, and what a difference it has made.The design is small and compact that it fits better anywhere you place it.  I was worried that the sound quality would be bad since it is so much smaller, but the volume is really loud at max and it has more bass then the original.  I\\'m really impressed with the built-in Mic, it now has 7 mic built-in pointing in all direction of the speaker.  It can hear me much further and understand me much better now. I also bought a smart power strip with this and plug in many of my electronic devices and it has made my life a lot better and I feel like living in the future.  I can now just say \"Alexa turn TV On\" \"Alexa Turn Printer On.\"  I can also use it as a blue tooth speaker to play my music when I go to sleep.Overall, it was worth it and definitely recommended it.  Be even better when you can get it while it is on sale, then it is a definite steal!\\r\\n            ', 'The easiest way to answer this question would be to simply put it this way. Echo is a great Artificial Intelligence (AI) that also happens to be a speaker. Home Pod is a great speaker that also has AI. Some will go so far as saying that Alexa is an Artificial Superintellegence (ASI) indicating that it is smarter the the human brain. Personally I can\\'t go that far.Artificial Intellegence:Echo, by far is the best at answering questions and controlling external devices. most of the time Echo will answer whatever question or inquiry I ask it to do. As long as you speak clearly and distinctly. If you fumble your words Alexa will not understand what you are asking. Home Pod will most of the time. Many times I have asked Siri a question through Home Pod and I get the response; \"Home Pod cannot answer that question\". For us Apple users we Know if you ask Siri a question through our iPhone or iPad she\\'ll respond by saying; \"Here\\'s what I\\'ve found on the internet\" forcing you to look at the display and manually select what information she displays.There are a couple of things that can be a bit annoying with Home Pod. First is if you have multiple Apple devices you\\'ll have to turn off the \"Hey Siri\" feature on these devices. Seeing as Home Pod only responds to this command, if you have multiple devices, all of them will respond to your query. Second, and most annoying is that many times if I\\'m talking on the phone Siri will start babbling about a word or phrase that I\\'ve said while talking. Which then forces me to ask the person I\\'m speaking with to excuse me while I deal with Siri. I\\'ll tell her to stop talking or simply shut up which she does.Sound Quality:Echo has a speaker that at most is adequate. It puts out a decent sound but not a high quality sound. This is where Home Pod shines! When you first pickup the Home Pod you\\'ll notice that it is heavy. This is because of the large magnets on the multiple speaker drivers that it has. The sound quality is absolutely amazing for such a small speaker! You can even buy 2 Home Pods (If you can afford it) and have them configured as Bluetooth stereo speakers. It is also loud! You can tell Siri to play at full volume and she will ask you; \"Are you sure you want to do this?\". Yes it is that loud!Summery:Both units have their place. Obviously I have both in my home. If you are looking for more of a personal assistant then Echo is your guy. If you are looking for high quality, room filling sound then it\\'s Home Pod. Also there is the matter of price. Echo retails for $99 where Home Pod is $350. You can get Echo for as low as $79 through special sales at different times during the year where Home Pod, like most Apple products is rarely discounted. Occasionally Best Buy will have a sale on them for $299.\\r\\n            ', 'Bought this as a \"replacement\" for an Echo Dot with the idea of getting better sound (and being able to use the Dot elsewhere).  Sound quality is somewhat better than the Dot, although I am not sure it quite lives up to the advertising.  But still an improvement, so in that regard it was a worthwhile upgrade.  Having a choice of finish and fabric is helpful, since the unit is significantly taller than the Dot and is, therefore, more obvious.  One downside I have noticed.  The new Echo is not as responsive to requests as the Dot.  The Dot would switch lights on and off fairly quickly.  The Echo has to think about the request for quite a while before it responds, sometimes to the point of giving up just as the light finally switches, and seems to miss more requests than the Dot.  Since I placed the Echo in the exact same spot as the Dot was and nothing has changed with my WIFI, I am pretty sure the difference is in the units themselves.\\r\\n            ', 'I\\'m sure whatever needed to be said about this product has been told on thousands of review before mine, so I\\'ll keep my review short and to the point. The way I\\'m using this product is basically as a remote speaker to play music depending on the mood I am. It works flawlessly for my purpose and it very easy to setup. If I\\'m doing math homework I simply ask Alexa to play classical music and she plays a very good selection of music without any other inputs from me. So far all the different genre of music have been perfect for my taste, which is surprising how accurate it is that it knows my taste so as a streaming music player, this thing rocks. The sound is loud enough, without being obnoxious and the quality is good enough for the price. I also purchased three remote electrical outlets that are compatible with Alexa and those were simple to add to the capabilities of the Echo, so I can simply say Alexa, \"office off\" and the Echo turns off the lamp. Overall I\\'m happy with my purchase and I am looking forward to discover additional capabilities this device can offer in the future. For now my only con is that it doesn\\'t have a battery, so I can\\'t move it around the house without losing power and waiting the 3-5 minutes it takes for it to reboot and reconnect to the network.\\r\\n            ', 'Got this as a Christmas gift for my parents. At first I thought being a different generation than myself that they would return it due to the possibility they wouldn’t even use it. Boy was I wrong!Within the first week it has changed the life’s of my entire house. My mother will ask Alexa to play her favorite songs and use it to make phone calls as well as answer our home phone calls since we also have the echo connect. We have now purchased Echo dots for every room in our house and love using the drop in command as an in home intercom system and now no longer have to yell from the top of our lungs to other family members when we need them or have a question for them. We simply drop into their echo dot and communicate with ease.\\r\\n            ', \"I bought this for my daughter for a holiday gift. It does everything as indicated in the description. She loves playing the games on it. But, set up wasn't as easy as it could have been. We set this echo up, and the dot, on the same evening (several hours apart), and we had problems getting both of them connected to the wifi. We had to make 5 attempts with both devices before they would connect. We think the reason why is that the Echo was undergoing an update (or the app on our phones), and until that was completed it just wasn't going to connect to where we could use it. The Echo powered on, and told us we were not connected to the web, but it did have some functionality. But, just as we were connecting after the 5th try, both of our phones told us that the update for the echo was complete. That's why we think there was an update that needed time to complete. While we were attempting to get the devices set up we kept getting other errors. So, if your Echo doesn't connect immediately, go for 5 tries. It might be the magic number. :-)  We probably spent about 15 - 20 mins per device getting them set up.\\r\\n            \", 'Love this , I mainly use it for music but you can ask it just about anything recipes, directions, etc.. but the rubber bottom must attach moisture because it left a ring on this cabinet.

I do wish I could share with my husband on his phone, it is probably possible, but I don't know how to do that. I do ask her questions occasionally instead of googling.  I don't mess with Alexa too much as far as all the other stuff she can do, or tell you(jokes, etc.). I have Amazon Prime and can get most music I ask to hear.  I do occasionally request a song that she says I must have Amazon Music Unlimited, but I don't want to subscribe to it just for the few times I haven't been able to get a specific song.

Theyre are some really good speakers out on the market Blu-Tooth, WiFi, or otherwise. Echo is probably one of the finer electronic devices being sold today.

Then I bought an Echo Plus, the one with the hub.  After figuring it all out, I ended up returning the Echo Plus and I bought 3 more Echo Dots.  With two of the dots, I bought MOKCAO POWER+ Cordless Speaker with Battery Base for Amazon Echo Dot 2nd Generation (https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0749K9C1T/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)'  I found that this speaker with a Dot gave me as good or better sound than having a full Echo or an Echo Plus.  The bonus is that each of them is portable so I can take it anywhere and treat it as a bluetooth speaker.  The 3rd Dot is now hard wired to my 7.1 Suround system in my gameroom and the 4th wired to my Bose Wave Radio in my garage.  So, as you can guess, I'm all in with Alexa.  The Dots are great if you can hook the up with a speaker as i have done with two or a stereo system as I have with the other two.  The Echo Show is the one we have in our morning room, the room we spend 90% of our time.  The reason is that it has very good sound quality all by itself and the screen is great for seeing lirics of songs.

I keep this one in the kitchen.  My son uses his dot downstairs and we keep another one in my other son's room.  No issues or confusion, they can all be playing different things at the same time.

Then when I am out shopping, all I have to do is open my Alex app on my phone and there is my list.  I can even cross off items as I get them.  I can ask Alexa to remind me about tasks that need to be done.  So convenient!  The best thing about it for me is the music selection we have, being Prime Members.

From music to reminders to even changing the channels on our Dish Network box, it’s a thoroughly enjoyable relationship.  Every morning Alexa says good morning to my wife by name.  She tells bad jokes. She gives all kinds of weather forecasts.  As a Sirius XM subscriber and a Prime subscriber, my music choices are vast and the Echo handles it all for me.  I’m changing all my timers both inside and outside the house to smart plugs which Alexa will control for me - makes it far simpler to have only one interface to learn.  I also have the Echo Spot which has replaced my clock radio by the bed.  It not only brings up my Ring cameras and doorbell but also has a great selection of wake up options.

I decided to come back and update my review of this product. As you know I originally gave the Echo second gen 3.5 stars. After WEEKS of googling and researching I FINALLY got Alexa to do what we bought her for. After spending 4 hours on the phone with both Amazon and SmartThings and getting no where I took matters into my own hands.Now don’t get me wrong, they both tried to do everything they could to help figure out why Alexa couldn’t find my hub for ST. After doing my own research and asking people on chat groups I figured out that it all came down to the fact that two locations were set up in my Samsung ST account. One automatically created with we added our new 4K TV to our account. That was the whole issue why it was only picking up the TV bc that location was the “true” location in the account. After I removed the TV and the location and set my hub location as the main “true” location it was all smooth sailing from there.I went in and disabled SmartThings and SmartThings ADT and then enabled the skills and everything popped up!!!! I set routines that is any door, window or motion is active she immediately informed us.Note: Yes technically Alro isn’t able to tell you motion through the Echo 2nd generation with the Arlo Skill BUT............ Alexa can if you use the ST skill and find the camera through the hub. Now Alexa informs us if there is motion around our home. You don’t have to have the Echo Show for her to do that if you use the ST skill.I hope this helps people out who I have read in the reviews who struggled with the same issue.The only reason my updated review wasn’t 5 stars is bc it took a lot of work to get the product set up the way it should be. Thanks!!!!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Hey everyone, so I want to love this product I really do and there are parts that I love and other parts that can be misleading. I will give you my break down.This gift was originally given to my 6 year old son who asked for Christmas for an Alexa. He ended up getting a google home which we ended up returning due to the fact we have everything amazon. We are Prime members so the obviously choice was Alexa.When we brought the google home back we were trying to decide if we should go with the dot or the echo. We decided to go with the echo because at the time I figured we have all our Smart Home camera’s and security set up through SmartThings and according to Amazon this was compatible with all our smart home devices.Now, here is where I am torn on what rating to give Echo. If it was strictly for what my son asked for which was telling us jokes and listening to music I would give her 5 stars.I love the fact I can at the sound of my voice tell her to play Ed Sheeran while I’m cleaning and his playlist starts right away. I also love that she has a skill for my grocery list app “AnyList”. That is a HUGE win for Alexa. All I do is tell her to add an item to our list and poof it’s there.Her skills for games are also great. Both my boys 6 and 4 love asking her questions and playing games. Again this is why I would give her a 5 based on just these things.Here is where I become torn. Alexa does work great with SOME of my smart home devices. It states that she is compatible with Arlo, which you can sync the cameras but she at this time does not have a skill to inform us about any motion. That is where this becomes misleading.It says the Alexa Echo is compatible with the SmartThings hub. Yes she is compatible but with our ADT SmartThings hub and security it is NOT yet fully functional in the US.I found this out by calling SmartThings then Amazon and for a total of three hours found out that at this time Alexa does not have the ability to arm and disarm your smart home security system. Arlo Cameras are ONLY functional through Alexa Show. You can pair your Arlo camera to Alexa Echo and Echo Plus but that is as far as that skill goes at this time.She does work well with our Ring Doorbell. She lets us know when someone is approaching.This is why I struggled giving more than 3.5 stars. Trust me I want to love this product and I do at times. I just felt I was mislead by some of her functions.If I could go back I would have probably purchased the Echo Show instead. Which I am sure one day I will.I truly hope Amazon works on the ADT SmartThings skill and the original SmartThings skill to make it able to arm and disarm smart security systems.\\r\\n            ', \"I have the original Gen 1, but this newer model is better in every way. When playing music, the sound is better, too. Esthetically, my wife prefers the soft covering over the pure metal version. And the smaller overall size makes it easier to put these anywhere in your home.If you have a smart home controller like Smartthings, you dont need the larger version of this device. My Smartthings already controls my Hue lights and smart outlets and switches, so I dont need the larger Echo -- this unit does everything I need.I absolutely love using the Drop-in feature throughout my home. I use it to tell my kids it's dinner time, or to call them when I need something. Drop-in works fantastically on this Echo.Although I use Sonos for home audio, I can still use this to play music in one room, or play the same song at every location I have an Echo device.I've tested Echo against the Google Home and Siri products, and IMO, Amazon beats them in just about every way. The Apple Homepod does put out good sound, but Sonos beats them hands down. And since I can control Sonos from Echo, I'll stay in the Echo ecosystem for AI.I would recommend this to friends and family, hands down. Well done, Amazon. You've changed the AI Home Automation game for the home user.\\r\\n            \", 'My husband & I kicked off our Alexa experience with a 2nd gen Dot in mid-December. It was fun learning the various things we can do with Alexa (note: we did not purchase the Dot specifically as a speaker). We also purchased a few companion products (Wemo plugs, Philips Hue bulbs, Vivint Home security, Firesticks) and enabled the corresponding smart home skills. We’ve also enabled quite a few additional skills over the last 2+ months. About the time that we started listening to music on our Dot, we decided that we liked the idea and were having fun with Alexa, enough that it would be worth it to purchase another device so we could have one on each of the upper 2 floors of our house. We purchased the Echo (sandstone fabric) in early January. The first thing we noticed is that the sound quality with music on the Echo is significantly better than the Dot. We’ve had no issues with either device not registering our commands, in fact, both devices routinely pick up our commands from one room away. That said, our house is fairly quiet, not much competing noise. These days, in addition to the smart home skills, we frequently stream a local radio station or Pandora on our Echo and find the sound quite acceptable! We’re not musicians but we do enjoy having music on, in the background, throughout the day. Overall, we continue to find new, sometimes interesting and helpful uses for Alexa & our Alexa devices. Also, we are very happy with the sandstone fabric, it has a nice, clean, neutral look.\\r\\n            ', 'I bought this for my boyfriend, and although he doesn\\'t use it much, I work from home and use it all day, every day.

Tomatoes are bad for dogs, Garlic is also bad for dogs, yes it is going to snow today, Sir Elton John is 70 years old, Rihanna\\'s first album was \"music of the sun\". Alexa is really just a cheerleader for me and my rightness. :) I recommend this product for anyone in a relationship with someone who is always wrong.\\r\\n            ', 'So I’m 19 and I have horrible memory problems from trauma, etc etc. and I got this hoping to help me keep track of things and start working on automating parts of my house. I was originally gonna get an iPad or something, but I already have an iPhone and I wanted something a bit different. I was worried that only using the voice control with no screen would be confusing, but this thing has been working SEAMLESSLY. First of all, the sound is GREAT. It’ll play my Spotify songs easily and it sounds amazing with adjustable equalizer in the Alexa app. Second, it’s easy to set alarms, look things up, get news, make lists or reminders, and a LOT more. For someone that has a hard time with day to day things because of my memory, the echo is like the personal assistant I could never afford to hire. Except I can afford this!! Okay I know this all sounds cliche but for real, this thing is legit. Before I got it I thought that it was a bit silly to buy an echo dot and stuff for every room in the house, but now that I have it, I want one for every room in the house. Long story short, it helps out people like me that have a hard time keeping their brain in order.\\r\\n            ', 'We like the improved sound and smaller size, along with the fabric cover that helps Alexa compliment our decor. The only negative (minus one star) was the change in volume control. Two individual buttons versus turning the top like a dial. Don\\'t like that very much at all. Sure, you can still ask her to turn the volume up or down, but we also enjoyed the convenience of turning the top of the Echo for volume control present on the first generation Echo. Alexa is still evolving, thus not as smart as you might expect, but she\\'s getting better. Our new Echo is now controlling our holiday lights (requires purchase of smart compatible plugs) with great ease. \"Alexa, turn on the holiday lights\" and the house lights up with Christmas cheer. A welcome addition to the family.\\r\\n            ', 'Echo (2nd Generation) - Charcoal Fabric + Echo DotHaving a Echo device has really made a huge difference in my days.

I could not be happier with my purchase and Alexa is constantly learning what I want and very accurately learning my voice tone and cadence, giving very little errors and issues while talking to my Echo device. I bundled the pack and gave my brother the Echo dot that came with and he as well is quite satisfied and we both are constantly using Alexa throughout the day for all our various needs. If you are on the fence you should not hesitate to make this purchase. While you are at it, take advantage of the bundle deal as a family member or friend will thank you for sure. Wanna feel like you are in the future already? Look no further. You can even change what she response to, instead of just Alexa. This includes \"computer\", Star Trek anyone? I\\'m a huge fan and nerd so this small detail really is just the cherry on top of a already amazing cake! Do it, buy it, love it!

I threw over our Google overlords for Alexa. Abooboo is our new leader, and we welcome her domination! However, Abooboo is not for the feint of heart, as she comes with little or no instructions. I had to google (ironic, right?) how to do things. Why can't I just ask her how to set up this feature or that? She says she doesn't know. I realize the days of instruction manuals are gone, but this gadget really needs one. More than once when working things out I almost threw her back in the box to Amazon. Heads up, guys.

I have turned our echoes into a perfect intercom system for our house.The only negative thing I can think of is that Alexa has difficulty with my husbands heavy Hispanic accent, but even Siri has a hard time with English that is less than perfect. I use Alexa to add items to my grocery list, schedule events for all of my family members, and even to play relaxing sounds (my favorite is Babbling Brook) to help me go to sleep at night!

So much smarter than Siri. We have a brand new 2nd gen unit and we already love it. With all the available skills and the ease of use, this is an amazing useful piece of tech. We are so excited. It understands everything we are asking for and so far has delivered answers that are accurate and on point. I was not aware of all the apps and services that can be used with this. And yes, you can connect your iPhone via bluetooth and play Apple Music via streaming. However with Amazon Music memberships dirt cheap I don’t see why you would not do that instead.\\r\\n            ', \"I like it so far.  I've had the original Echo for a couple of years, and I added this one for the bedroom.  The sound is pretty good, maybe not quite as nice as my larger Echo.  I had one issue for two days after I setup the Echo 2.  I noticed something was dominating my WiFi and slowing other things down.  It turned out to be related to the Echo 2.  When I unplugged it from the power my WiFi settled back to normal.  I searched and searched through help topics trying to find why this was happening, and I found nothing.  What I finally figured out on my own is this.  I setup a group so I could play the same thing on both Echos at once, plus I could use them as an intercom.  It seems the units were constantly 'talking' over WiFi to monitor for messages.  When I deleted the group my WiFi bandwidth returned to normal. I think this should have been pointed out somewhere in the help information.  If it in fact is, it should be easier to find.  I never did find it.  That's what cost the this product one star.\\r\\n            \", \"This is the 2nd echo I've owned (actually 3rd; the dot and the previous gen echo).  General impressions are as follows:Good:The size reduction is a nice plus; sound has somewhat improved from the original echo (even tho it is still a little muddy depending on what type of music it plays).Bad:I have a pretty fast connection and from time to time I have to repeat myself to use commands (ex: checking the weather, setting a reminder, etc).  Also the calling phone numbers feature needs a little work (most ot the time whenever rI ask to call someone from my contacts it simply shuts down w/o performing the command).  Not sure this is more an Alexa feature or the echo itself.In general I don't regret buying it, however I don't know if I would recommend it as an upgrade to the previous echo.  I'd look into the larger size echo perhaps or consider other smart speakers with Alexa included.\\r\\n            \", 'Love this item! Alexa is our new best friend. My Significant Other suffered a Spinal Cord Injury and has limited use of his hands which makes using a cell phone difficult. The Echo allows him to make hands free calls which has been a life saver for us!\\r\\n            ', 'I like the echo, but its not without its flaws.First of all the sound is very loud, surprisingly so actually, but at max volume there is quite a bit of distortion so I would recommend keeping it a notch or so below max.Second, the bass is very nice for some songs, but for others its incredibly overdone and lacking in the mids/highs.Alexa is fairly responsive and so far responds correctly to most commands.It supports multiple music platforms such as Pandora, Prime Music Unlimited and others, but notably absent is support for Apple music. You can work around this by using the it as a bluetooth speaker, but that takes a big part of the functionality away so this is a workaround at best.It was very easy to setup, even for someone who may not be very technical.The third party \"skills\" have a lot to be desired in my opinion, most are so full of ads they are unusable, Id like to see this improved. I\\'d rather see the option to pay a few bucks to \"buy\" the skill vs a subscription or tons of ads even if they are just ads for their own product.\\r\\n            ', \"I was a little angry that my wife spent money on this stupid thing, to begin. I would not use it, the entire concept was ridiculous and inane.BUTThe kid loved it. My wife loved it.Next thing I know, I'm using the stupid thing - and I kind of like it. After that, I bought two of the Echo Dots and four smart plugs and a Kindle Fire TV and of course I have to say that now, I like it. I gave it five stars because my wife will be broken hearted if she finds out that I don't really like it.I definitely don't ask Alexis to play rain sounds at night before bed.I definitely don't ask Alexis what the weather will is every morning before I get out of bed.As I stated before, this is a stupid product and I don't like it.Okay I like it a little.\\r\\n            \", 'I was timid; I started with a couple of Dots; but this 2nd gen Echo sounds so much better. Not every room needs the richness of full sound, so my Dots still have their uses. This Echo, however, is now at the center of my entertaining area.The difference in sound is like the difference between driving ground traffic and the highway. Whatever is included in the additional 4-inches of height is really adding to the fullness and range of the audio output. Not that an Echo Dot is the worst, but this 2nd gen is just that much better.One of the best qualities of such a richness of sound is that music playback does not need to be loud to be appreciated. With this 2nd gen, it is no longer a choice between enjoying music and not disturbing others. I can easily hear good quality audio across my great room, while the neighbors remain unaware. Although the sound does carry in open air, I only need to close a door for anyone upstairs to be left in peace.When its time to entertain, I can stream the same music across a group of all my Echo devices, and even the Dots do their part to add to the experience. So yeah, NO! Nobody gets my old Dots; no matter how many hints they drop.\\r\\n            ', 'We have two dots and have each connected to an Amazon speaker.We wanted to have one unit with good sound for the bedroom.We listen to old time radio stories in the evening.

Lots of choices and many very good programs - for instance \"Gunsmoke\" or many of the detectives, comedy and music..We had some trouble as we placed it on the middle shelf of a bedroom set of shelves.Alexa couldn\\'t find me very well.So put echo on the top of the shelves and she has done so much better.

It hears me when I speak at a lower volume than the dot (makes me sound less like a crazy person) - and the sound is AWESOME - gives my Bose portable system a real run for the money.  I've linked it with the other dots using the Group function (easy to set up). Random note - we have two homes and set up all the dots and echo on the Group function and then tested if we say play music everywhere it actually plays at both homes at the same time. Hilarious. I know we can make it NOT do that but it was just amusing to check on our security system. BTW we have them linked to our $100 thermostats and that is helpful at night when too lazy to get up and change the temp - also if headed out and forget to turn the A/C on or off before we leave or when headed home.\\r\\n            \", \"Let me start by saying that this is my first echo device. I got it because i know a few people who have them and they've recommended me to it. To make this review easy and to the point i have listed it's core aspects below and i'll say what i like about them and what i don't like about them.1. Design - The design of this device is quite stylish. It sports a black leather casing that can be swapped out at any time for a new case. If it happens to get dirty, just put a new one on and it's like new again!2. Sound - With this being a speaker, you can't review it without talking about its sound quality. The sound quality on this is quite excellent for it's size and is able to be quite loud in a decent sized room. The highs are crisp and the bass is enough to make my desk rattle.3. Alexa - Alexa works okay on here. However, there are times (more often then not) where she can't hear me and i have to talk pretty loud. Other times, she do a command that is the exact opposite of what i wanted her to do in the first place. This happens all the time and gets pretty annoying to the point where i just stop using it for a while.Verdict - This speaker is small, stylish, and packs great sound into an inexpensive smart speaker.\\r\\n            \", 'I own both the Echo (2nd generator) and the latest Google Home and acquired them for the music, news and weather info, not to run my house.  Thought it would be helpful if I gave my experience with both.  the speakers for both units are roughly equal and very good.  the quality from such small units is really quite impressive.  Personally and for my limited purposes I thought the Google Home was the \"smarter\" of the two.  Example if I ask Echo if today will be windy, I get weather forecast, largely consisting of the temperature, but no wind info.  Ask the same of Google Home and I get the wind without all the rest (which it will provide if asked).  PLUS: Google allows you to upload your personal music library and the Home will play it.  Amazon no longer allows that option.  The response time for both units is about the same and both are easy to set up .......  What makes Echo a better choice for me is that I am a Prime member and  as such I get much better music selection than on Google Home and I could upgrade to better selections for about an additional $4 a month after one month free trial.  To receive something similar from Google it will cost you about $10 a month.  Bottom line if you are not a Prime member, Google Home seems like a better choice to me, particularly because of the uploading your music library feature.  Because of that feature on Google and being a Prime member I acquired both.  Regardless, they are both amazing pieces of equipment.\\r\\n            ', \"Update: 3/12/2018: added a new Echo 2nd Gen to my living room replacing my original Echo 1st Gen. The sound quality is better than Gen 1 in my opinion and the microphones pick up my commands much better. I’m glad I invested in the new Gen 2.——————————I have the original Echo, several Echo Dots and now the All-new Echo (2nd Gen) and love them all. I don't know why some give the new Echo bad reviews: mine works great and the sound has no issue for me. I got the new one for another room because I wanted a better music experience in a room that only had the Echo Dot. This did the trick nicely. I was able to relocate that Echo Dot to another location where I want Alexa to respond to smarthome commands, so the Echo was a great choice for me. I am totally hooked on Echo and Alexa. Marvelous invention.\\r\\n            \", 'I have a family of 5 including 3 children under 11. Alexa has been a great addition to our family! From impromptu dance offs to family game night, kids court for discussions and disagreements, timers and reminders,  updates on package tracking, and making calls, sending texts, and more while hands free —we love it! The drop in feature comes in handy when trying to call the kids down from upstairs for dinner too! Highly recommended!\\r\\n            ', 'I love this product. I got this for my eight-year-old daughter. The reason is because she wants to listen to music. And I thought that’s the best way to do it. She ask Alexa to play your favorite music. It’s easy to use. You can ask Alexa lots of stuff. Although there are some downsides on the product as well. There is some music that you need to pay in order to listen to them. And also I am from Iran. I was thinking that I can use this product to listen to Persian songs as well. But it seems that the only songs that I can listen to is the one available in Amazon or three radio station.

The Echo is a great start, although you could just as easily get away with an Echo Dot if all you want is voice commands and responses. You would almost be better off with a set of 2.1 PC speakers plugged into a Dot if you want to use your Echo devices for music. Where the Echo really shines is in a stereo pair mode with another Echo and an Echo Sub. If you don\\'t just like music, but love music, then this setup is hard to beat, especially with an Amazon Music subscription. The Echo is a good speaker on its own, but in \"Echo 2.1\" it is beautiful.I highly recommend deciding upon the purpose of your Echo device in your home before buying. The Dots are cheaper and perform the same functions, just with a smaller speaker. The Echos are louder and have better sound but at double the cost of a Dot. If you want Amazon music streaming throughout your house, the Echos and the Echo Sub are well worth the cost.\\r\\n            ', 'I just got this today and if I only used it to listen to music I would have been beyond impressed.. the sound is awesome and the response is so fast from Alexa it is almost scary.. Love love love it... I have tried a few games and it was also fun, asked a few questions and got good answers, not all the time but pretty darn good results considering I have been using it less than 12 hours.. can not wait to show this off to family and friends.. will really be great when when I can control my directv with it.. soon I am sure. best $80 I spent this year.\\r\\n            ', \"In spite of all the new smart speakers with an AI companion of their own hitting the market, Amazon is still dominating the market as they are way ahead of the curve.

I would write a 10 paragraph review, but you can type it in google if you want to see what the Echo is capable of. I am definitely happy with its capabilities and functions and use it as the entertainment center of my home. I really do the love the ability to ready your kindle books similar to how Siri will read aloud on your iPhone. But if you purchase Audible books as well, Alexa will play those as well. Keep up the good work Amazon!\\r\\n            \", \"I love the echo that we purchased a few months ago.  For years we've been using a boombox (from the 90s) since our cell phones were not good enough to use as a radio in our house.  We saw Alexa as a way to have music in the house, which she does, but she does so much more too.  My favorite functions are playing music, setting a timer, adding things to my shopping list, and calling my kids at home through Alexa.  I had no idea when I bought it that my husband would take to it so well.  We were all stuck listening to David Bowe at high volumes for a few days after it arrived.  :)  The one we got is charcoal gray, and while it is not an object d'art, it is really useful and not offensive to my decor.  I can easily move it from one room to another without losing settings or anything if I need to.  I'm considering getting an additional dot for another part of the house.  It was easy to set up.  I'm ok with technology, but really it only took me like, 10 minutes to set everything up, so it is not hard.  I was at a furniture store the other day when my kids called me through Alexa.  Our furniture store associate thought that was so cool he had me help him connect to his Echo so he could call his kid and it took about 1 minute to set up.  I do find the calling to be echo-y though--it's not crystal clear sound for the calling in my experience.  I had read some of the reviews about the music speaker sound not being that great, and I found that it is perfectly fine for our family.  I love that I can play pandora and I heart radio on it.  One thing I wish it could do is play library-rented audio books.  It will only play audio books from audible currently.  You can have Alexa read books to you but I find that her automated voice is really annoying for book reading--inflections are all wrong.  So, it is not perfected, but it is a great purchase none the less.\\r\\n            \", 'We were not looking for a personal speaker, our original intention was a sound machine for white noise. After researching options we discovered that the Echo would give us what we wanted and things we had not thought about for a great price.We use it for white noise (fan sounds) allowing us to remove the fan from our bedroom.  This is a big deal, fans had been a fixture for dare I say 40 years. Now less dust, more room, and no loss of comfort. We also have Fire TV we could integrate with the Echo which is surprisingly convenient. One of those things you don’t realize you want until you have it.Echo has also replaced alarm clocks, I use it to play podcasts while working out as well. Biggest surprise was the quality of sound allowing us to use it for music.  Our Echo has become a household workhorse.For the price and given its versatility I highly recommend. Still learning all it can do and finding it has become an important part of our daily life.\\r\\n            ', 'We are having so much fun with Alexa. She is almost like a real person. She arranges music whether old or new, classic or rock, answers questions, and even tells jokes. During a Christmas celebration, our grandson was eating meatballs. Someone said be careful and not sneeze or the meatball might roll off the table like in the old song I remember as a child. We wondered what happened to the meatball in the song. Alexa found the \"On Top of Spaghetti\" song and played it to the delight of everyone.We have not hooked up the adapter to be able to shut off lights, call people, or do other things yet. The Echo is easy to use and the sound system is wonderful and clear.Alexa is now in 4 different family households since Christmas. Everyone loves Alexa and the Echo.\\r\\n            ', 'Alexa is great, I think the speaker sound is very good and I love playing trivia games with my friends and calling out and having her play music on my whim, but Alexa also has some listening problems. To give some context I was raised in the midwest and have virtually no accent, and a very clear and loud voice, however sometimes Alexa has difficulty understanding or hearing my voice. This isnt a constant issue, but still an occasional nuisance. Amazon music also isnt free, even if you already have Amazon prime, ALOT of music is included with Amazon Prime, but alot also isnt, which is disappointing considering it is the most convienient way to listen to specific music with Alex using voice commands. Overall, I would probably rate Alexa at 3.5 stars because I love talking to it and the convienience factor it offers, but it definitely could be better.\\r\\n            ', 'Alexa is pretty cool. Speaker sounds great, fills the room nicely even at full volume. No distortion . Sometimes she randomly says stuff as if I asked her a question. And one thing that throws her off is \" I\\'d love to buy a Lexus\" lol. Oh, and even with music blasting, she can hear you across the room with no issue. So your not screaming like a maniac. Wish she was on my phone. Would be amazing as a digital assistant instead of Google. (Yeah I know you can have the Alexa app, but it has to be always open.) People tend to look at you funny when your saying \"OK GOOGLE\" 400 times before it picks up. And, I forgot, she connects with my phone just by asking her too so I can stream music. Disconnects the same way. She\\'ll randomly connect sometimes without me asking, might be my dumb LG5 though. It has issues.\\r\\n            ', 'Traded in my  old girl and got this spiffy new model.

I promptly went to activate her and followed the instructions and NOPE! She was not having any part of it. I was using my cell phone and alexa app and it would not go any further than letting me find her in my settings but would not let me connect to the wifi.. Tried several times to no avail. I ended up calling support and we got her activated but had to do it from my laptop. She was then up and going and me so happy! The dot found her and works fine, nothing to be done with that but whats odd is where my dot has sat for 2 years now was not getting the wifi so it kept cutting off.

I wish I had had this when my kids were in the \"But Why?\" phase, it\\'s so nice to ask them if they asked Alexa and this isn\\'t about putting off my kids - we talk A LOT, but this is about when they have a ton of questions and I am not Google, I admit it is interesting to hear the answers she gives. Also I would like to note that my two youngest have begun to speak much more clearly, the peer pressure of getting snickered at because you aren\\'t understood does wonders and we are a loving family so there are no bad feelings just rueful exasperation from the mush-mouthed questioner. I will say I wish Alexa interacted better with manners, it might sound ridiculous to some people but manners matter and it\\'s a social habit that should be maintained at all times. The sound quality is really good, though I wish for better bass.. a future add on feature perhaps? I am a little sad the wake word is so limited, I would like to name this new family member like I did the others both kids and fur-kids. I also wish the timer sounds were different, they blend into a busy household - last I checked between the alarm and timer sounds one was customizable and the other was not and yes this makes a big difference when using Alexa on the fly.

The sound is at its best around half way up or around 60% volume.Alexa doesn’t get what I ask her but that could be my accent so I cannot blame her for that.The phone answer did not work for me while the music was playing so I returned the echo connect device. It basically answered the phone while it was playing the music so you and the person on the phone could hear the music and did not carry the conversation because of it.I still have not used a smart device with it so cannot comment on it.Overall I give this product a 4 stars for it’s sound quality and the product looks and the material used to make it.Perhaps I should have purchased the Echo Plus, I don’t know?

I still have the occasional issue with it even responding to \"Alexa\", same issue I\\'ve noticed on the older model(s).

Is the sound better than a Gen 1 Echo? No. Is it close? Yes. Close enough to convince me to keep it and hope they can keep tweaking the audio a little bit more instead of the rushed fix to prevent everyone from returning their new Echos. Overall I'm happy with the purchase now instead of the immediate regret in the purchase.\\r\\n            \", 'As this is my first Echo, the sound output is far superior to the Echo Dot devices I had purchased in the past.

Base is good, mids fine and the high notes are decent. There is a fine line between good and tin-ee (like a tin can speaker) sounding highs, the Echo is not tin-ee sounding at all.I do like the option to play music that is synced up with my other Dots, this must be a fairly new function I was unaware of.

The size an sound were great just did not fit my homes needs. It workes in conjunction with the Amazon fire tablet through the Alexa app or you can download it,  but we mostly have apple devices an it did stream from my iPhone very well. I would suggest a lot of research for your home's existing smart devices to see if they will work before you purchase, they must work with Alexa which you connect the echo with so it's a hand in hand an you can download the app an not have a fire device an set it up but again you must ad skills which are the programs that connect your smart device with Alexa then it's connected to the echo which is connected to alexa an you must speak it in certain phrases.

First, the AUX Out jack is difficult to use since a cover provides little clearance; I like that I can connect to my home audio system for even better sound.  Second, I wish there were smaller changes in volume when going up or down by one increment.

It's so nice to not have to wait to dial one of our cell phones if we know one of us is home.One of the only other things I'll mention in the way of a complaint, is that sometimes you have to be over specific when making a music request.

Alexa is still learning my accent but so far she showed to be smarter than Siri.At least Alexa's answers are more complex and elaborated than Siri. Besides you can ask her to play music from any source, Pandora, iHeart radio, Amazon and Apple and it works with any smartphone, better than homePod from Apple that maybe has a better sound but it is very limited in terms of connections.

Throughout the day, I add things to either my \"to do\" list or to my \"shopping\" list. One of the handiest tasks it does is \"remind me\". If asked, it will remind me of events during the day, appointments, when to get ready (I am often late for appointments so this keeps me on schedule better), and things left on my task list for the day.

My advice is to be patient; the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step.My biggest issue of the moment is that we have several Echo devices in our home and I would like to use them as intercoms (which I am told can be done).  However, I can't make any of the Echos aware of the others existence.  When I ask Alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name.

I use her daily to tell me the news, set timers and reminders, and of course, listen to music. I think the speakers are excellent, the sounds quality is very good. I was worried this would be yet one more piece of technology I would be required to spend hour upon hour getting things set up like music, but her built in selection of music is excellent.

I would highly recommend it for anyone that's interested in purchasing one of these.

Only disappointment is that we cant link our amazon wireless speaker to our whole house music. They are adding stuff all the time so hopefully that will update in the near future. You can now use your devices as a whole house speaker system which we really enjoy. With a 5 bedroom house it makes it very convenient to speak to other family members in other parts of the house without having to yell or drop what you’re doing to go across the house. It does take a bit of time to figure things out for the first time but if you have patience with yourself as you learn all that it offers you’ll be glad you purchased.\\r\\n            ', 'I am senior who is reluctant about adopting modern technologies since they often prove to be a passing fad. I was given an Echo for Christmas and reluctantly decided to give it a chance.  I found it to be transformative as a technology, so much, that I had to purchase another to extend its uses throughout my house.  The most important feature is that its simple and intuitive to setup, really appreciate that since I am not a patient person and quick to dismiss a product that requires too much fussing.  I find it great for streaming music and news stations from multiply sources including my SiriusXM account. Great as an alarm clock, calendar reminder and timer especially when cooking or as an interval timer for exercise.  Love the fact that I can create an audible grocery list as I inventory kitchen/bath.  Especially useful as an intercom for speaking to others across the house or making hands free phone calls. All this utility packed in a single device, its great!

After researching the problem it turned out that it just needed to be connected to the second frequency on our Wi-Fi which was too crowded with other devices.

It listens well, maybe too well. Some times she interiors me when I\\'m not talking TO it. Like if I\\'m talking ABOUT Alexa, and mention \"alexa\" she jumps in. So she is ALWAYS listening.She can turn the lights on/off, adjust the temp of the house , lock doors and more if you have compatible devices.So many capabilities.\\r\\n            ', \"I have been amazed by the quality of the sound. I like to listen to classical music much of the time and did not expect the sound on such a small item to sound as rich as this does. I also like the ability to ask for a composer, not a specific piece, and Alexa will shuffle through and pick pieces to listen to over an extended time without having to go back every time a piece is completed and give further instructions. The only difficulty I've had is that my voice is soft and often Alexa does not hear me accurately in requesting a softer or louder sound.

Buying another for my office at work. 1 * off because the build of this is not what it could be. The sides are soft and could easily be torn or bent if it fell over. I brought a great stand to go with it but a case  or stand should come with it because of the speaker material on the sides of it.

My daughter has a Dot and the quality and sound between the Dot and Echo is vastly different and worth the difference in price. I only wish it would connect to more music apps. I use slacker and would like that to connect as well as the music that is stored on my phone. It would be nice if it could play the playlist I have already built on my device.

I like the silly things like jokes, limericks, and songs.  I haven't even scratched the surface of the tasks it can do.  It's helping to keep my old brain sharp.  I don't have a smart phone or a smart house so there are many features I can't use, but that's on me, not the Echo.  I am enjoying this so much I am thinking of getting a dot or two.

I then put it on the floor in the corner of my game room, hidden, and it sounds great. Crystal clear and good bass attenuation (Note: it only has a 2” woofer so it does not replace a full sub). Also, the features and ease of use with Alexa is very nice. Having the ability to connect it two my two echo dots upstairs and in the living room, connected via aux to my main systems, works great because You can create zones to listen to different music in each location or create a group and listen to the same music everywhere. We really enjoy the ability to create lists for shopping or trips because from anywhere in the house you just say, “Alexa, add sugar to grocery list” and it is there. Very convieniant.

It worked effortlessly for about 5 days...then I lost the wi-fi connection.  Followed every instruction I could find to fix this, including contacting my internet service provided who assured me all was fine on their end.  Since my other devices were working, I then called Customer Service, sent the Echo in for repair, got it back 4 days later and tried again.  Same problem, so it was returned, and a brand new one was delivered immediately.  When I connected that one, I had the same issue.  I decided it was NOT an Echo problem and that it had to be a wi-if connection problem.  Decided to order a new router with stronger capabilities and, as of today, the problem has been resolved.  For those of you leaving 1 star reviews due to connectivity issues, I suggest you look a bit further to determine if a stronger router would take care of this issue for you as it did for me.  And thank you, Amazon, for all you did to try and alleviate this problem when your product was not to blame at all.\\r\\n            ', 'I got this as a gift for my husband who doesn\\'t have a smartphone.

I don\\'t know if it\\'s the pitch of my voice or that I naturally don\\'t speak loudly.  The music sounds great on it.  Although I can\\'t ask for a specific song or I get a sample.  I signed up for Amazon prime so he could play his favorite artists.  It will play the artist\\'s songs and you can skip.  So far I have one smart outlet to try before setting up more and probably won\\'t.  I have a light attached and once in awhile it goes off and on for no reason.

UPDATE: 2017.11.04 - Amazon pushed an update to 2 of my new Echo\\'s (the 3rd was not on line yet) - the new software version is 592452420.  the update made a noticeable improvement in the sound; better bass but still slightly shallow.  I then set up my 3rd echo (software version 588443420) and the sound was night and day.  I played a mix of the same songs side by side and the updated device sounds much better.  I have raised my rating from 2 stars to 4 - hoping additional updates will make this even better.I had high hopes for the 2nd Generation Echo and like many others, pre-ordered the 3-pack based on the promise of \"improved sound\".  The sound is much worse than the original Echo and I would even say that the Tap sounds better than this...but I guess Amazon didn\\'t lie...the 2nd Generation Echo does sound better than the Dot.  But seriously, the sound quality is horrible for music - almost zero base and very \"tinny\" at volume, it\\'s almost like a tin can with a speaker.  There is a slight improvement in vocals and Alexa\\'s voice - if you are looking for an aesthetically pleasing voice assistant and playing music is not a priority, this may be for you - but for enjoying music, this is a fail.  I will give this a few days to see if Amazon makes any firmware changes - or see if there is a \"break-in period\" as some had mentioned, but will most likely be returning.\\r\\n            ', 'The Alexa feature is very good at understanding commands and responding.

While definitely not going to be perfect, cloud updates allows Alexa to be constantly improving on her feedback and listening while still having the original Alexa. She's not going to understand obscure song titles or things in languages other than English, but she will improve over time.The physical product itself is well-built and will last an extended period of time as long as it's not placed in precarious locations or being knocked about. The buttons are responsive enough to serve their intended purpose, but they do not feel like they are meant to be used primarily as a way of controlling the device. If these buttons eventually fail on you for some reason, however, Alexa can serve as a substitute for all of the functions they serve. Sound quality is excellent for the price and size of the product, with ample volume settings to fill whatever room you want (up to a point).The ability to connect to other Echo devices is definitely a plus for creating your own house party with a song playing across all speakers, but quality in that sense is of course dependent on the other devices as well.\\r\\n            \", 'I have really enjoyed getting into using these to create a smarter home.

I already know the name of the song and where it’s coming from so I don’t need this repeated every time I request a song. I’ve submitted the request to the tech department multiple times but it seems that for now we are stuck with the announcements.

Put one in the family room and another in my bedroom where I can have it play a Pandora playlist and stop playing automatically an hour later if I want to.  The wi-fi reception is better than the Fire HD-10 tablet I have sitting right next to it.  It's great as an intercom to talk to the echo in the den, any of several echo dots I have and the other Echo 2 in the family room.

I\\'ve heard some negative reviews for sound which are completely erroneous. These are not a whole home audiophile sound system and are not intended as such, that said they sound amazing for what small cheap little speakers are in them. While not as good as my home theater I do use them while working/cleaning around the house since I have my music everywhere and no matter where I go I can hear it.  Connectivity was a snap since they come pre-paired to my account.  All I had to do was set them up on my Wifi which took a minute each.  I have had 1 issue with multiple echos responding to voice commands but have since taken care of that by subtile rearrangement of them.  I use the \"Drop in\" whole home intercom system a lot.  I\\'m waiting for more functionality in the Fire TV skill.

It\\'s not a Sonos or some high-end speaker, but for a $99 speaker it\\'s very good.We have the Echo Plus, the Echo (2nd Gen), and the Echo Dot. We found the sound on the Echo Plus to be superior to the Echo (even after all the firmware updates). We also like the twist dial knob for volume on the Echo Plus over the plus/minus buttons (the same as the Echo Dot) on the Echo 2nd Gen. As for voice recognition both the Echo Plus and Echo 2nd Gen are fantastic...I\\'m talking music full blast and you can casually say \"Alexa\" and it hears you.I\\'d rate this 4.5 stars and the Echo Plus 5 stars. The Echo Plus sounds better and I prefer the twist dial knob for volume control vs buttons. The built in smart hub and free Hue light that come with the Echo Plus along with the better sound makes it worth the extra $50 compared to Echo 2nd Gen.

I do hope they make the 3rd gen where you can swap the fabric as needed like the dots but it's so stylish. The blue ring is in full glory as well ;) hey I warned you I'm a huge fan haha.Look on YouTube under Zachus, there's a video where you can see the size. It's about half the size of the original.

We have a great 5.1 stereo downstairs but this Echo is so much more convenient. We are still exploring all of things that Alexa can do for us. So far she has performed admirably. We can tell her to play a particular type of music, i.e. Country, Oldies, Folk, 70's, 80,s and so forth. Or one can tell her to play a particular artist. For instance I had her play Marty Robins and then Johnny Horton followed by Hank Williams SR. Alexa will also provide the listener with the weather report, a news summary or how the stock markets are doing currently. I know that she can do a lot more and we will continue to explore her capabilities. For right now though she is the main crew's entertainment center when we are in the kitchen.

I guess the update really kicks up the juice.  I am not an audiophile by any means.  I like my music to sound good but I do not obsess over mids, bass and treble.

I\\'ve heard that some people are uncomfortable with Alexa\\'s ability to hear everything you say, but this doesn\\'t bother me at all.  She doesn\\'t turn on unless I use her name, so if I find myself wanting to say something dangerous, I just don\\'t use her name.

Alexa is great in the kitchen (timers and unit conversions), wonderful at entertaining (music and games), and incredibly helpful (answering questions and controlling lights).  I have to admit that my wife has not yet warmed up to the idea of asking Alexa to turn on and off lights, but she definitely enjoys having Alexa play music and getting quick answers to questions.  Be forewarned, getting an Echo will forever change your life.\\r\\n            \", 'Having already owned 2 of the 1st Generation Echo devices, I decided to buy a third one to expand my collection of smart devices. It’s important to note that you don’t really need to have one Echo per room as the Echo Dots provide the same functionality as their big brother, however, in my case I wanted a louder speaker for each of the rooms with those devices. Connecting the Echo Dot to a higher end speaker is also always an option of course.As far as design goes, the second generation Echo look much more aesthetically appealing. As you can see from the photos, it’s a little bit over half the height of the original. It’s also a slightly bit thicker than the first generation but it’s not really something you can catch with the eye, you have to stack them on top of each other to see the very minor increase in width. I included a photo of a can of soda next to the Echos as I think that’s a good reference point for someone that has never seen the device up close. The new fabric design makes it less awkward to have in your living room, making it look less like a gadget and more like a complementary decoration. It’s also fairly simple to remove the fabric sleeve and replace it with a difference color if you ever feel bored of staring at the same design. All you have to do is push on a round button at the base of the Echo and the sleeve starts coming right off.You can make voice commands through Alexa with both of these devices, but the second generation seems to be able to distinguish my voice better and from a farther distance. This is mainly due to the fact that this new iteration of the Echo has seven microphones on the top face whereas the older version has only one microphone.I was a little bit disappointed with the sound of this new iteration though. Personally, it seems to me that the sound seems louder on both of my First Generation Echos. It’s still a great speaker though, loud and clear sound, so I wouldn’t discourage anyone from purchasing this awesome device. I guess that I was just expecting to hear and notable improvement on the loudness of it.If you already own a first generation Echo I wouldn’t advice you get rid of it just to upgrade to the second generation, unless your goal is to have a more modern design, but in terms of functionality it’s almost the same thing. Overall if you don’t already have an Echo device, I would highly recommend getting this one, it looks much better than the original and it’s not as tall, better voice recognition, and the difference in sound is not much to be a problem, at least not for me.Note: I won both of the First Generation Echos I have at a raffle at my job, hence the reason it has “Showtime” printed on it, I’m not in any way affiliated with them. The second generation Echo I’m reviewing here I did purchase during Cyber Monday sale.\\r\\n            ', \"Update review: Amazon pushed out a firmware review and it seems to have fixed the issues that plagued the item upon initial release. The Echo responds quicker and most importantly sounds MUCH better. I still do not believe that it's as big of a sound as the first Echo though. One thing that I did leave out from my first review is that there are physical volume control buttons now! This was my only real complaint about the 1st gen Echo. I didn't want to have to tell Alexa over and over to lower/raise the volume. Now I do not have to.Original review: I was pretty excited to get the Echo 2. I was expecting great sound, fast response to commands and a better looking device. What I received was one of those three.The Echo 2 does look really nice but that doesn’t matter much when talking about voice assistant speaker. The sound quality is a major step backwards from Echo 1. Everything sounds muffled on Echo 2. I did a side by side comparison and the Echo 1 just sounds so much better.Also, the Echo 2 does not respond to commands as fast as Echo 1. In fact, I had many situations were Alexa would acknowledge my command but the system would not perform it. I would say “Alexa play the Beatles.” Alexa would saying “Playing the Beatles.” Nothing happens. This essentially makes the speaker worthless.I hope this was a bad batch and the Echo 2 gets better. Echo 1 was is such a great device. I can’t believe Amazon took such a step backwards.\\r\\n            \", \"I have the Echo placed in my kitchen and Alexa has become my new best friend! She plays my audio books and favorite music, makes my grocery list, places phone calls for me, gives me the news update, and even tells me the temperature outside.

No, but it is just plain fun to play around with. I love it!\\r\\n            \", 'Love my new echo, where has Alexa been my whole life.

Very compact size, lots of commands I enjoy. I just dislike the fact that it is good enough for just one room of my house so I ordered an Echo Dot as well and will coordinate the music to play the same songs at the same time so I can hear it in more areas of my place. The other thing I didn't like is it can make calls out sure, but you can't answer them unless the other person has an Echo or Alexa device as well. For me I don't need the extra gadgets of the house applications like turning on lights or safety devices so this is good instead of spending another $75 for the upgraded version.\\r\\n            \", \"When we first received our Echo, we weren't sure what we were going to do with it.

On my way home from work, I drop in on the kids to make sure they're doing their homework. I listen to a podcast or my latest book on Audible when I get home from work and then review the recipes for dinner while I'm cooking.

It is a handy tool but there is a learning curve on how to ask questions.  The news comes in at different volumes, which is annoying when a user is hearing impaired.  Some news reports are too loud and others too soft to hear.  The sound should be consistent for all of them.  Often tasks must be added to the app before it will function.  Lists can be controlled by voice, but to remove an item the app must be used.  If voice can add, why not delete items?  Improvements surely are forthcoming but there are no security safeguards for voice ordering, so it seems best to leave that feature turned off for the device seems eager to order things without giving price information and just with a query.  It is entertaining, but after the 30 day trial is over there are charges for too many things that were advertised as features that appeared to come with the device.

I saw the Echo 2nd gen was available on sale at one point and picked one up for the bedroom. Great decision! The sound is so much better than the Echo dot. It has far more power than the dot, so we never bring the volume over 5, and keep it at 3 or 4 when sleeping. And the richness of the sound is so much better.

As I work in IT security I rolled my eyes at the idea of me installing a \"listening device\" in my house.Well, I played with it a couple hours and ordered a Dot. The next day I bought an Echo too.I\\'m a music lover and its music features alone are what sold me. Connected to a free Pandora and Prime account,  I have lots of music at my fingertips. I\\'m branching into roots music and being new to it I constantly hear new songs. It is a good thing I don\\'t get charged every time I say, \"Alexa, who is this?\" and \"Alexa, I like this\" which upvotes it in Pandora so it learns my tastes. And therein lies its beauty. I can be cooking, reading, cleaning, or anything you can imagine and interact with music services like I had a servant catering to my every desire. On a whim with just a few words. Without having to pick up a damn phone or fiddle with knobs.It isn\\'t a high end, high power audio system. But I find the quality and volume more than adequate around the house. If I want it louder I can easily plug it in to my home audio system or plug/pair it with my bluetooth speaker...which was twice the price and wasn\\'t anything but a speaker.As for the security concerns, I just go in the bathroom and turn on the exhaust fan and shower when I want to talk privately. JUST KIDDING!! Several things made me believe the features were worth the small risk (and EVERYTHING carries some risk):1. I live alone so it doesn\\'t have much to hear. But even if I didn\\'t I don\\'t think I\\'d be too concerned.2. It isn\\'t supposed to send anything to Amazon until activated by its attention word (Alexa by default). If it ever got out that it was sending sound before that, it might mark the end of the market for these devices. Well, maybe not, we\\'re putting up with similar crap from phone OS and apps, ISP snooping, video surveillance everywhere, web site trackers, etc.3. If it collected credit card numbers or medical information that might put all of Amazon or Google\\'s home device infrastructure in scope for PCI or HIPAA compliance. Something they\\'d probably prefer to avoid. ;) Equifax and probably a dozen other companies already gave away my national password, er, SSN. But I digress.Like I said, its capabilities as a versatile, easy, hands free interface to music services is why I bought it (and its low price and wanting to have music more distributed around the house).All its other features are frosting on the cake. I\\'m not particularly interested in home automation but I\\'ll probably tinker with it at some point. It might be useful to make and receive hands free phone calls if it can do that. Information lookup? Bleh. It isn\\'t often I want a sound bite answer to anything. Voice purchases? Probably not. I\\'m likely to order repeat stuff while I\\'m online shopping for other stuff or looking at a menu. And tying voice actuation to a credit card attached account seems like an accident waiting to happen. Programming capabilities and routines? I\\'ll have to see how powerful the API is. In the back of my mind I\\'m thinking of how it might be useful to tie it to my Karafun account and maybe FireTV if my PS3 ever dies. Or maybe tie it to local event web sites so I can say, \"Alexa, what\\'s happening in town tonight?\". Maybe it can already do something like that. I don\\'t know. I\\'m a newbie.BTW, I bought a second echo. I don\\'t splurge often but having a music genie in another room for $79 was too hard to pass up.Why did I buy Amazon over Google? Price.

First, the replaced the volume dial on the top with a volume up/down button now.  Also, this device is a little shorter with a soft fabric around the speaker.  it looks very sleek and modern.  Access to all the popular music streaming services, as well as Amazon Music will have you head over heels with options.  It is a super smart speaker so ask it anything from the weather, traffic, trivia, measurements, news, and even jokes!  Look up some of the easter egg phrases you can get out of it as well.Sound/MicrophoneThis little speaker gets amazing smooth sound and does not distort or crackle at higher volumes.  The bass/treble balance is perfect for our kitchen.  Our kitchen is open to the living room and it everything can be heard clearly and fills it completely.

Because of the new look, it will fit most modern household decor!ConclusionI love the fact that they took something great and were able to still improve on it.

This is annoying because it HAS connected and is playing music!Also needs updating is the Apple Music integration. Needs to be able to play smart playlists on Apple Music, and to be able to add shuffle to the commands (such as play XYZ playlist, shuffled). Right now you have to ask it to play a playlist, then ask it to shuffle.I would also like to see the light ring at the top be used as a visual way to count down a timer!Fix that and the product would be excellent!\\r\\n            ', 'I have to admit I am a little blown away by the sound quality.

To my ears, the sound is better than the original. The highs seem crisper and the lows a little richer. If you are an 'audiophile' you will surely be disappointed. But, for the other 99.9% of us, it is a decent speaker. My only real complaint about the Echos (and not just this model) is that the multi-speaker audio is really flakey in my experience.

For most people its not a bad thing, but with a toddler I have to keep this out of reach and it def struggles to pick up my requests when she is 6 or 7 feet up as compared to a 3 foot end table.

Recenntly, I found that version 2 is just a little more \"finicky\" when reconnecting to the wifi.  Testing these side buy side, version 2 required a power disconnect to make a recovery wifi hook-up (failure and trouble notice red ring on status); version 1 recovered without issue.  If having an extended battery (at around $50 extra on top of the sdded price differance between version 1 and version 2) is important, I would see this as being the only reason to buy the more expensive version 2.\\r\\n            ', 'We didn\\'t purchase Amazon echo - Alexa, we got it as a gift.The initial instruction was a little lacking on information, but we figured that pretty quick that we needed to login to amazon account and get the install link for Amazon echo, after that it was pretty simple and easy to install and it worked!The entire setup time was less than 5min.There are many features built in the Amazon echo, if your house is not a \"smart house\" and connected to your smart phone then Alexa can\\'t do much like turn on the TV, lights on/off or turn on/off the AC or lower the shades.it\\'s convenient when you do not need to be on your PC to look for something Alexa can look it up for you using voice command or when cooking and need a quick recipe Alexa is right there to help you cook.If you\\'re Amazon Prime you can have unlimited music or listen to any radio station.Bottom line it\\'s a helpful smart device, that can help you do things quick and when your hands are holding your groceries or something and need the lights on Alexa can do that for you.Enjoy Alexa as you enjoy life.\\r\\n            ', 'I got the Amazon Echo 2nd Generation for Christmas and it is by far the best gift I have had in a long time.

You can yell from the next room \"Alexa, turn it down\" and she will.  If I hear a song I like but do not know the artist, I just ask who it is and she tells me.  Sometimes I just say \"Alexa, play songs from the 70s and she does\".  You can ask for recipes or directions.  I tell her to put appointments on my calendar and it does.  You can tell it what to put on your shopping list and it will go on your phone if you have an I-phone or android.  I have a Microsoft Lumia Windows phone and it is not compatible for that feature unfortunately. When I put something in the oven, I tell her to remind me when to check it.

We use the intercom feature to talk to each other when in separate rooms on different floors: \"dinner\\'s ready\", etc. I have even used it to place phone calls- the sound is often clearer than on cell-to-cell calls. Linking it to Audible is another handy feature of which we have made use, as my husband and I like to relax and listen to books together. Every morning my husband listens to his flash briefing while eating his breakfast, and then checks with Alexa for his commute time to work.

I see so many uses of this for the elderly or disabled that would be so beneficial.  Just need to bring price down so they can afford it. The things I wish it could do better, is play my specific stations on Pandora, it says it cannot do that.  It can play music from my Pandora account, just not by station request.

The audio is great, I can make calls and listen to music , just ask and Alexia does it. The kids like asking for songs they like and very easy to use.The Harmony hub took a little bit of reading to figure out what I wanted to use it for. As I said earlier I have a budget Hisense TV with spectrum cable box and a high end nighthawk gaming router. After 2 hours I added Xbox, cable box, Apple TV , TV and tested all devices. Activities are easy to setup and test, after done I synced Harmony and asked Alexia to discover devices and happy ever since!I plan on getting a Fire Tv As I think it will work better when using Plex or Netflix. Apple TV used to be primary device and after switching to Plex I did not want to pay 150.00 when I can buy 3 Fire TVs for about same price that has plex, Amazon and Netflix and will be more friendly with Alexia. The big plus with Harmony is I can use app on Iphone to fine tune selections in menus and type in text for movie searches. One thing I would like to see is to be able to create our own custome layout in remote app.I plan on using some lighting products, probably Phillips so We can turn on basic household items.Echo could use some fine tuning for help, for instance if I say Alexia, Plex, I wish easier to find out what to say by asking, sometimes I talk 5 or six times until I get right order🙂 but for this smart stuff being out just a few years, it ought to make things easier when I get older and lazy !Great products, easy to use without being a super geek.\\r\\n            ', 'this is not only a lot of fun to use but the speaker sound quality is excellent, better than any other speakers I have bought and a great deal for a quality speaker with my music.

We need better sound.\" and so I ordered this.  We\\'ve had it for four days, but what a joy it has been.  We stayed up late dancing on Friday night and remiscing as Alexa played music we hadn\\'t heard it years.  The sound quality is AMAZING.  The Echo has helped us so much in these last few days - making hands free phone calls, setting timers while cooking, giving me the weather, etc. etc.  We LOVE this.

But you will come across verbal commands that Alexa JUST won\\'t understand YET. Sometimes your unit will even perk up and listen if a word is close to the wake command \"ALEXA\". There will also be requests of specific data that she just doesn\\'t understand yet,such as long sentences for information. I\\'m guessing that the unit listens for key words,and attempts to execute that command word.The performance at this early stage of progression is still great,but hardly an intelligent AI of sorts. IT\\'s definitely a verbal web browser,without the bells and whistles of other devices or skills to operate or perform. I\\'m looking forward to its future progress as Amazon improves it.\\r\\n            ', \"I've been using the Echo Dot in my house for a while so decided to add one more Echo to the household.

I love how easy all of the Echos make playing Audible books. The ease of setting reminders, timers, and alarms is wonderful. If I remember something important as I am about to fall asleep rather than turning on the light and searching for pen and paper, or grabbing my phone to set a reminder, I can tell Alexa to remind me in the morning without needing to even open my eyes!\\r\\n            \", 'After visiting a friend whose home is equipped with bluetooth surveillance, Echos, and Dots, I was amazed at how efficient and helpful these modern tech systems have become.

I can ask it to play songs and podcasts, set alarms and reminders and turn on and off my lights and even arm my security system and lock my doors. The speaker in it is very good for the size and sufficiently loud for most people. However I am a super LOUD music listener and I still ended up hooking it up to the loudest Bluetooth speaker I have ever found, my audster audM-500. So if you are a loud music junky like I am, a dot will do you just fine.. as you will hook it up to another speaker anyway. If you prefer medium loud volumes and not insanely loud volumes...than the echo is the way to go and you will save the cost of a different speaker. It is also soo much easier to use than I was expecting.\\r\\n            ', 'I spent a lot of time researching this purchase prior to ordering the Exho. I’ve been an “apple” guy for a long time. I couldn’t find anyone who thought the features offered justified the price and the HomePod didn’t support my music provider of choice, Spotify.Joining the amazon universes has turned out better than I could have hoped for. Echo, seamlessly, supports Spotify (as well as most other music content providers from what I understand). Voice recognition is outstanding (dare I say it, much better than Siri). Sound quality is comparable with other Bluetooth speakers of this size (I’ve owed several).The real surprise here was the content. Amazon refers to these as skills but what they amount to are lots and lots of tasks that the echo can perform, much like apps on a smartphone. Enabling individual skills allow you to access news, weatheer, sports, current events, and educational content in many different platforms and styles, as well as lots and lots of games.Echo links with your phone to enable phone calls, texts, reminders, and calendar events. Alexa will tell you joke, play your favorite radio station, give you a word of the day and tell you what to expect from the weather for today, or some day in the near future, just by asking.This would be a great deal for an alarm clock that functions as a radio as well. Considering the quality of the content provided, the features included, and the performance level achieved this is a steal at $100 ($69 on sale).Within a week I ordered 3 of the smaller (but with all the same features other than sound quality) echo dots. I still love my apple stuff but Have plenty of affection left over for Alexa.\\r\\n            ', 'This was our way of dipping our toe in the home-assistant pool. We are pretty impressed with how well Alexa responds to commands. We use our little network of Echos and Echo Dots to control everything from our security system to our Insteon Smart Switches and lighting and it works great. In my opinion, if you are a Prime member this is the home-assistant for you. I am also a prime music member, which adds another element of usefulness. A few things we use it for:- Listening to whole-house music \"Alexa Play Music by Budos Band Everywhere\" and there you have it, all of the Echos are playing the same music!- Turning our smart home lighting on and off- It\\'s our alarm clock. We finally ditched the horrible sounding and looking 30 year old alarm clock- Alexa \"How many cups are in a quart?\" Instant answer!- \"Alexa, ask Harmony to turn the TV on\"-  Building a shopping list when you run out of things, instead of trying to remember what you need later in the week \"Alexa, add 13 gallon trash bags to my shopping cart\"The sound from the Echo is pretty good too. I wouldn\\'t use it to replace a good stereo receiver with speakers, but when I just want some background music while I\\'m working around the house, it\\'s great!

Be sure to look up all the extra features you can do with the Echo and don't forget to not say her name unless you want her to listen. The light up features are a good option to notice if she is awake or has an issue. Would like to explore different voice tones but this one isn't too bad overall.

I wouldn't say the sound is better across the board. The balance is better (though custom equalizer functionality would be much preferred), and the speakers are better (clearer).

I also love the hands free messaging and phone calls. Within the skills section you can tech Alexa to do pretty close to what you want. She now has manners when I say good morning to her, tell jokes, help me remember important appointments and much more! I was so impressed that I bought the echo dot for my family.

So I upped to the 5.1, found out the two speakers that I had, were actually the rears in a designed 5.1 system. I now compare the system to a much more expensive wired system, with expensive dac, amp, and four towers with 15 inch bass.

Support from them is good at times and other times I have been chat/phone and get transferred multiple times and at the end, I am more frustrated than before, but other times I get great support above and beyond. So Alexa has limited at best natural response. if you have not enabled the mysterious skills that you are somehow supposed to know yourself of the 30k or so what you need than Alex is not too smart and says \"hmm or I don\\'t know that one\" a lot.  Once it is set up is is kind of fun and works well when it knows what I want, but to me, it needs more naturalization and the multiple Echo/Alexa device setup/integration needs to be refined. there are random syncing issues and many times all device same time will stop responding.I just wanted to give my honest experience. My advice is to if you buy 1 or many to plug in and set up, then wait a few hours to a day to ensure all updates are made to the device, then spend a good bit of time looking at a video and reading forums before you decide what all you want to be set up. Then 1 by one set them up. If you have an issue first check forums and then try calling for support. Chat is ok, but my best experience has been over the phone.I think Amazon should include a quick troubleshooting guide and a chart explaining the colors and when and why they are there. And a better way to figure out what skills you need.All said and done, I have learned a good bit of time and learned this is not an item you can just plug in and go...

The echo can hear me in all 3 rooms which is great and I love to hear the holiday music all day.I would highly recommend this echo.

I look forward to trying out some of it\\'s Smart Home features like lights and outlets, but at this time I am only reviewing the device itself.First, the bad... err, not perfect:I\\'ll get my biggest gripes out of the way now. One issue I\\'ve had is Alexa not recognizing her wake word, \"Computer\" all the time. I\\'d say at least 30% of the time she just doesn\\'t respond, even after having her learn my voice. I tested other wake words, but it doesn\\'t seem to matter, if it\\'s not a silent room she\\'s probably not going to hear me. However, watching Star Trek is quite interesting because she hears every single time they say, \"Computer\". Her response is typically, \"Hmm, I don\\'t know about that\", or she just starts playing some random song she thought was requested. This may get better with time as the instructions say she continues to learn your voice. We\\'ll see.My second issue is with the quality of the speaker. While I love the range of volume and EQ abilities it has, it\\'s not a very good speaker. It sounds like cheap headphones that are just turned up really loud. Music is slightly muffled, not so much that I suspect damage or fault, but noticeably low quality. This isn\\'t a deal breaker, though. While a slight disappointment, I\\'m sure my expectations were a bit too high, and it certainly won\\'t stop me from getting more Echo devices. And to be clear, Alexa\\'s actual voice is quite clear. (It\\'s not so bad)Now, for the things I like:This thing isn\\'t just amazing me more every day, it\\'s helping me with my daily life in ways I hadn\\'t expected. I\\'m a Stay-at-Home-Dad who homeschools 3 of 4 children, all while doing normal Homemaker things like cooking, cleaning, fixing, scheduling, playing taxi, etc. On top of that, I deal with ADHD and Anxiety daily. Alexa makes it super easy for me to organize my day. I can set quick timers and reminders, calendar events for school and important appointments, and I don\\'t even have to remember to check my schedule, she\\'ll tell what I need to know and when. I can even link her shopping list with Wunderlist and just tell her dinner ingredients to shop for while I\\'m thinking of it. No more forgetting broth for the soup. Alexa can solve quick math for me so I don\\'t look like someone who hasn\\'t divided fractions in 20 years. I can (and have) set up routines that remind me daily to log school hours, take a break to stretch and be active, start dinner, etc. I can\\'t say enough good things about how the Echo has changed how we do things in our home, and so far it\\'s all for the better. I have plans to buy two more Echos (the Dot and Kids Dot) this week, and I can think of a dozen other ways I could use Smart Home devices or even more Echos.

The farfield voice recognition is superior over the 1st gen no more screaming to wake Alexa. The compact design makes the device visually less intrusive, more stable, and opens up a bit more flexibility as to it's placement.Now the big question is how is the audio? Of all my echo devices as listed it's got the most bass, audio sounds richer. It doesn't get quite as loud as the first gen and Show. I tested this by playing the same song on the everywhere setting. Meaning the same song played on all my devices at the same time. I went from room to room and noticed that the best sounding echo device was the second gen. In all fairness I did not take in to account the acoustics of the room and sizes with my test.I do miss the spin dial on top for volume control, but other than that I'm extremely satisfied with the second gen's performance.\\r\\n            \", \"Exceeded expectations.

Also great for listening to podcasts and for playing the public radio station. Haven't used it much to listen to news because I find that a bit slow, but can see that it could be helpful. We set it up in the kitchen, where Alexa can set timers, answer questions about measurements, all useful. We've also used her to pay a few games and answer questions Lots of uses for a product we've only had a short time.

I\\'m sure as time goes on, she will improve greatly... hope it\\'s sooner than later. I use the echos mostly for music and reminders, but would like Alexa to be more helpful. Four stars for now.\\r\\n            ', \"Received this one as a gift, and we hooked it up to our lighting automation (via Wink), so we can now do voice commands.

Lots of good play-lists that act more like a themed radio station without the commercials or comments. It will also play music and playlists from my iTunes /library account. Best thing about the device - fantastic sound quality! It's hard to believe it can be that good of quality out of such a small unit.

Not too hard to set up either once you download the Alexa app, it pretty much walks you through the process. But once it’s hooked to your phone and WiFi you kinda got figure things out on your own from there but it’s not bad once you start playing around with the app. Also, super easy to hook up to WiFi plugs. One thing to know though is that the Alexa app will not hook up to plugs and switches on its own, you have to download a separate app that is for the specific smart plug or switch brand that you buy. It will tell you in the instructions that come with he product you buy. But it’s super easy to do and once you’ve downloaded that app, Alexa will find the plug or switch on her own and walk you through the set up which literally takes two minutes! I bought four plugs with my Alexa to start off with, it’s been awesome to control lights with just the sound of my voice or the push of a button if I’m not home! I especially love that my wife can cut the lights on if she is coming home late and I’m not home. She and our children dont have to walk into a dark house! I am excited about adding other smart plugs and switches! I also love the fact that I can call people with Alexa, I just tell her who to call and she does it. I never have to pick up a my phone. I just talk to them through her. Once she’s hooked up to your phone she knows your contacts. Definitely an awesome product and for what your getting, an awesome price!\\r\\n            ', 'I resisted any voice recognition/big brother eavesdropping devices because of security concerns, but when I decided that having this in my \"man cave\" wouldn\\'t be an issue I reluctantly decided to give the Echo a shot.

I purchased it to use as an auxiliary speaker for my TV which sits across a large room making me turn the TV volume up ridiculously loud, but once I hooked it up and connected it to my WIFI and Prime Account it is crazy convenient. If I want to know the weather, I ask it. If I want a joke, I ask for one. If I want to know the price of something I ask it. If I want information on something I ask it.  this thing is basically a voice activated Google search engine that speaks back to you.If you are…or know of someone that has trouble with computers or with typing, I would highly recommend one.I may even start using my wholefoods acct with prime to start ordering groceries because, yes. It can do that too.\\r\\n            ', 'Worked great for approximately 9 months. Loved the product. Good quality music from a small speaker. Then when playing music it would cut in and out.  We unpluged the unit and plugged it back in to see if that would cure the problem with no affect.Recently rebooted my WiFi system (unplugged router and modem and then plugged in modem and then router), then plugged in echo. That cured the problem. Suspect kitchen appliances made have affected echo’s WiFi connection. Modem and router are of good quality and only about 2 years old.

I am happy to say that the latest software update has dramatically improved the sound quality.  It seems to produce a louder volume than the first generation.  I also hear a more full sounding bass.  Some people may not agree with that depending on the type of music you are listening to.  Most anything with a steady thumping bass will not sound as good as it would through a subwoofer.  Most other types of music sound rich and full.  I enjoy old and new country music and it sounds great.\\r\\n            ', 'I just received an Echo for my birthday.

You can say \"Alexa, what profile?\"  And say \"Alexa, switch profile\" if your Echo is mis-identified and acting strange like mine.

Placed on the nightstand and no troubles at all.The sound quality as I’ve already stated is impressive. I have a Pioneer stereo with massive speakers, and once the EQ is adjusted on the Echo, the sound quality comes pretty close to my monster sized speakers.If you’re looking for a stereo but space is an issue, this Echo is a definite plus.

I have a plus and a sub too which are both very good editions.

Follow all instructions and if there is a problem, Amazon has a great help sight. So, outside of playing music or telling a joke, I am very impressed as I am setting up a whole home automation. It paired great with the Philips Hue bulbs, Echo Dot and Harmony Hub. Setting up the Groups, Devices and Scenes in the Echo took a little while and then setting up Routines on my iPhone, a bit longer. Only your imagination can hold you back on the endless possibilities for this! So far, I have lights, TV, satellite, DVR, my receiver and even Netflix set up with much more to come. A simple \"Alexa, Good Morning\" command can get your TV and lights up along with the news of the day and weather report right at your voice.

We have 3 now and we couldn't be happier.Oh and they look great too!!IMPORTANT:  You can trust my advice;  I've been using Echos since the pre-release of the very first one.

I feared it would end up a white elephant; nice to play with at first and getting bored of it soon after.

Some examples are: getting my news updates, currency conversions, playing music, white noise, controlling the room lights, tv and soundbar and enabling me to call home from my cell anywhere in the world to the Echo. I'm still discovering more uses for this and likewise I'm sure you will find it equally productive if you are considering this.

My son hooked it up for me - not because it was too difficult, but because I am lazy when it comes to electronics and didn't even try.

What I was pleased to discover is that once it is connected to internet it works directly with the cloud and I don't have to have my phone or tablet on for it to work.  Probably younger people would know that already but it was a pleasant discovery for me.I am disappointed that it doesn't work to call others unless they have an Alexa app on their phone.

That is our child who is non-verbal can use her commuterized communication device to ask Alexa to play various music stations on Amazon Music.  We find this to be effective almost all of the time.  The computerized voice is not recognized unless it is within 5 feet of the Echo. I think perhaps because it is trained to listen for human voices.  That being said, it still does recognize the communication device, and that is important to us.

If you do have this service, you can ask Alexa to play a particular song, artist, genre of music, ask her your local weather, etc.  If you have devices that connect to Alexa such as smart plugs for lamps, etc., you can program Alexa to turn lights on and off with your voice.  You can operate these smart devices once they are linked to Alexa using your voice.I also stream video using an Amazon Fire Stick on my TV and it uses Alexa to find movies, applications, etc.  This makes your voice a powerful tool.  When connected to your phone, she can send messages, order stuff for you on Amazon (how convenient), give you a recipe, etc.  The list goes on and on...I also found that Alexa quickly understood my questions.  Using an Alexa app on your smartphone, you can give Amazon feedback as to whether she understood what you were asking for.  This helped greatly with voice recognition.  She certainly does better than the voice recognition device I have in my car.They are adding new applications for this device all of the time and you will get emails from Amazon Echo notifying you of her new capabilities.\\r\\n            ', 'This is the most awesome device I have.

My little brother likes to play pranks by ordering Alexa to make stupid purchases. 3) Without a stable internet connection, Alexa is completely useless. 4) When you program Alexa to speak a custom phrase, commas are the only way to evoke a pause in her announcement. All other punctuation is simply treated as a space.  Overall, Alexa is an amazing accessory to any modern home.

Functionality was limited to turning bulbs on and off and changing their brightness - no creating scenes, routines, using geolocation to auto-control. Another \"bonus\" of the Plus: after pairing the bulbs to and then deciding that we wanted to try pairing to the Philips hub that came with the 4 pack of bulbs, it was impossible. Spent an hour+ attempting to reset the bulbs, but once paired with the Plus hub, they remain undiscoverable for the Hue hub, even after unpairing with the Plus. I saw other people say they sat on the phone with customer service for an eternity, attempting to reset the bulbs to factory settings, only to reach the same conclusion we did. Already frustrated, I spared myself a further headache and simply returned and repurchased the 4 pack and hub.

I decided to hold off then, but here we are a year later and the idea of home automation is quite a bit more appealing to me now than it was a year ago. I decided to get my feet wet with an Echo and some Philips Hue bulbs. Setup was pretty straightforward, the Echo was up and running and controlling the Philips Hue bulbs in about 10 minutes.I was immediately impressed with the Echo\\'s sound quality when playing music. It actually has some decent bass for being such a tiny thing. I had originally intended on placing it in the kitchen, which is more or less centrally located in the house; however, when I tried playing some music the sound quality was good enough that I figured it would be a potential replacement for my bedside alarm clock radio. I now have it in the bedroom and it does a really great job of filling the room with sound, with surprising bass given the small form factor. I was secondly impressed by the Echo\\'s mic pickup; just as a test I tried giving a command from near the kitchen with the bedroom door closed (but not shut) and it picked up my command (I wasn\\'t yelling, either).The integration with the Philips Hue bulbs is what I initially got the Echo for, and it rocks for that. It\\'s handy being able to tell the Echo to turn on or off certain lights from elsewhere in the house; for example, no more walks down a dark hallway to the bathroom in the middle of the night - I can ask Alexa to turn on the bathroom lights as I\\'m getting out of bed, and the hallway is sufficiently illuminated for me (without turning on bedroom lights that might disturb others). Also nice if you\\'re laying in bed falling asleep and just don\\'t want to get up to flick the light switch off - just ask Alexa \"turn off the bedroom lights\". You also get dimming control, which is great. And, you can control them while away from the home - never walk into a dark home again.My initial impression with the Echo and the Philips Hue bulbs was positive enough that I went out and got another four pack of bulbs and a Dot for the kitchen. I may eventually put another Echo in the kitchen (for the superior sound quality listening to music over the Dot), and then relocate the Dot to the living room or another bedroom, or wherever ends up making most sense.

He has gotten it hooked up and he was so excited when he called be yesterday on it. It was just such a wonderful feeling that maybe, just maybe this gave him some independence back.

His condition will only get worse, but hopefully even if this helps just for a few weeks or months it is worth it to him and our family. Also he lives 12 hrs away from us. This allows him not to have someone get his phone for him or anything. SO GREAT. I am so appreciative of the technology that is available.

I wish he had a landline, but i have had all family members program his local 911 Agency phone number in their phone, so he can call any of us and we can call them. I am a 911 dispatcher and this was the only way i could see to make this work without a land line.!!!!

I have it connected to two smart outlets and being able to control my lights via Alexa is great.Having it connected to my Audible account let's me relax with a book reading, and I can jam out in the shower because it's linked into my Amazon music and Spotify account.I ordered some surge protectors by tell her to order them. Didn't need to pick up my phone it get on the computer. 2 days later, I got surge protectors.The only downside is that if ANY commercial for Alexa comes on (and there's a few on Hulu) it will pick up the command from the tv.\\r\\n            \", \"I was excited to get the Echo (2nd generation) to try out the music and also use it for other things such as an alarm, timer, reminder, control lighting, etc. I also have a couple of Dots (two level home), and my husband was unimpressed with the sound of music using the Dots. Wow! What a vast improvement with the Echo. It sounds better than my stereo system, and using it with my two Dots, I can have music throughout the house. It's especially fun with the Christmas Music! I found the Echo, Dots, and Smart Plugs very easy to set up and use, and admit that I am not a particularly Tech savvy person.  They have been very helpful and enjoyable.\\r\\n            \", 'I’m very happy with the 2nd generation Echo. For the price and value you can do a lot. The reponsiveness is quick and accurate. The sound quality is not the best however it’s not bad, there is the option to connect via bluetooth or wire to external speakers for better sound quality. As an iPhone user I have all my music through iTunes which is not something that works well with Alexa, I’m hoping there will be a solution to that in the near future. Since I live in a heavily congested city my real time traffic news is very important so that I can plan my commute, Echo does not yet have a very reliable app or skill that can help me with this. I can get a basic direction and drive time from Echo but you can get that from your smart phone just by speaking to it. There is a lot of potential with Echo and I am already trying to automate a lot of things around the house and hope that in the near future I can add more products that work well with Echo.\\r\\n            ', \"Got all of my grandchildren an Echo for Christmas and they were thrilled.  They are using it primarily for music, as am I, but everyone has enjoyed seeing what Alexa can do and playing games with her.  My husband asks her questions that require a judgement on her part which, of course, she can't respond to.  He is the only one who is less than thrilled.  The sound system fills the room and it is so convenient to request a song or an artist.  Some of my requests aren't on Amazon Prime music, so she goes to Pandora.

Alexa, resume, Alexa, go forward one chapter.  You can also look up on the internet all the funny questions/commands for Alexa.  Open the pod bay doors.  Beam me up.  Tell me a joke.

I started out with the Echo dot and found out how easy it is to listen to music without commercials then upgraded to this echo device which is so much superior with sound quality over the dot. We still use the dot...moved it to the garage! With wifi and a prime subscription, you can listen to a whole world of music. I am hoping one day Amazon will include inputs so you can use it as surround sound for the TV too.\\r\\n            ', 'We have Alexa in the kitchen where we are a lot. She was really easy to set up which I did on my iPhone. She works amazingly well. It is like playing Simon Says with the Echo. You must address the Echo with Alexa before she listens to you. She will even pick up her name if you are speaking of her. Playing music is what we use the Echo for mostly, but she is a good timer, just say \"Alexa, give me a timer for ten minutes.\" When the ten minutes are up, she dings and dongs until you tell her to stop. I love this device so much, I had them sent to my children for their enjoyment.\\r\\n            ', \"OMG! Amazing! Why did I wait so long to get this? Wow it understands my voice so well.

What I don't like is that amazon music is not as good as google music, in fact not even close, and lots of functionality is missing for instance: I would love to use this setup as the main speakers for my computer, but that is not possible and another annoyance is that I added a plex server to my NAS in order to use the amazon speaker setup with my own music. But only one alexa speaker will connect to the plex server skill. It is not aware of the pairing of the 2 speakers with a sub. Things like this hopefully will get fixed as this product matures.\\r\\n            \", \"Alexa may not be the smartest, but It is the most useful!  For smart home stuff its unmatched by any other ai speaker!  the sound quality isn't the best, but its decent and reliable, its what you would expect for $99.  the microphones could be a bit better since this is the primary function of this speaker, but they do hear you at normal volumes.  build quality is pretty good, and customization is a plus.  the fact that you can just say alexa and not hey this or hey that every time is a blessing, makes the interaction a lot more normal.  overall its the best smart speaker you can buy, and im glad I took the chance to look outside of the apple ecosystem and branching out to make my home alexa compatible.\\r\\n            \", \"I'm 63 and not real techy. I have started to create a Smart home. Alexa is turning on lights, where as before I would have to turn on 2 lights to get to the light I wanted. So energy saving. I've been listening to music from my childhood for hours on end. I have her connected to my Smart TV so at a command, she turns it on and I command her to Netflix.  I am always seeking more knowledge so Alexa answers many math, geography or science questions. I love in the am, I get news and weather before getting out of bed. Set-up for me was fairly easy.

The new Echo may sound better - not sure, it is in a very large room and I was happy with the older one.  But I find in playing games it very frequently does not hear my response or mishears it.  Not sure if there is a learning curve that is the problem, but it is quite frustrating.  Hoping it improves over time, but at this point the only improvement I find of note is its appearance.\\r\\n            ', \"I have read about 1,000 reviews before buying this.. most of them complain about the sound quality and the fact that Alexa talks to them randomly without being summoned. Honestly, I think the sound quality is above average for what this is. Never had it talk unless asked a question. Always recognizes what music or whatever I ask of it.  The only thing I can think of that irks me a bit is that when you order a skill, you have to hit the back arrow on your phone to get back to the list of skills and it brings you right back to the top...so you have to find where you were and scroll to that point to keep looking at all of the many skills. Just found out that I'm getting another one free with a promotion for Verizon...will put it in another room and hopefully they connect with each other.\\r\\n            \", \"I own an Echo Show, Echo {1st Generation), Echo dot (1st Generation).  With this purchase, during Black Friday deals, I now have an Echo (2nd Generation) and an Echo Dot (2nd Generation).  I purchased each one of these items so I can have music or talk radio playing through out the house.  I really like the fabric choices of this 2nd Generation Echo.  I also like that it is smaller than the 1st Generation Echo.  I do not notice a sound difference in the speakers.  I think both speakers are very good.  A year ago I did not have Echo in the house and figured I did not need Alexa.  Well, I am now a convert.  I consider having Alexa here a real asset.  I can find out what the temperature and weather is outside at my whim.  She will set timers to help keep me on schedule.  I can ask her to set an alarm for 6:20 am and she complies.  I can tell her to play for an hour and a half and she turns off as directed.  Because Alexa is constantly improving, I imagine there are things in the future she will assist me with that I have not even imagined today.  If you are the type of person who just wants to take a product out of the box and with very little effort on your part have it do everything you have read about, you will be disappointed in Alexa.  If however, you like searching for and trying new apps, then you are going to be extremely pleased with Alexa.  My recommendation (born from experience) would be to purchase this 2nd Generation Echo.  The Echo Dot has its purpose, but this item is the better item.  The Echo Dot makes a nice gift or using it in a room where you don't want to take up much space.\\r\\n            \", 'Not bad, but I was hoping it would be better than the first generation that I already have.  The audio quality of both generations have something to be desired.  Apparently, in an attempt to improve the low end frequencies, the Amazon engineers have over equalized bass, but unfortunately the end result is murky voice reproduction on both male and female speakers. The high frequencies are somewhat missing and with them the intelligibility. They both are better in the low frequencies than the Dots, which lack any lows, but, interestingly, the Dots have better mid range and general voice intelligibility.\\r\\n            ', 'I got the echo over the echo dot because I really love music. The sound difference between the echo and the dot is HUGE, and as a music lover I am really happy with this system.I\\'ve seen lots of people criticize the echo for \"not sounding good enough.\" I\\'m really curious what these people\\'s definitiin of \"good enough\" is. I don\\'t work in the music industry, audio is not my business, and I don\\'t own any Bose products, but as an every day Spotify dwelling pesant, I\\'m really impressed with the echo. It sounds way better than my headphones and way better than the dot, and it gets LOUD.I\\'ll say this though - I would like an interface to adjust bass/trebel. You can adjust it by telling Alexa to \"increase/decrease woofer\" and \"increase/decrease tweeter,\" but after issuing the command to decrease the bass several times, she continues to shake the floor of my second floor apartment at any volume higher than 2. I have the echo sitting on my computer desk. I\\'m sure my neighbors don\\'t appreciate this :(Regarding Alexa herself - I love her, and she\\'s really great with smart home stuff. I am an adult with ADHD and use her to set reminders and alarns. One time my husband locked himself out of the apartment and used Alexa\\'s \"drop in\" feature to page the echo dot on my nightstand - he woke me right up and I let him in.

Instead I bought an inexpensive Bluetooth portable speaker and have been living with the slightly improved sound and flaky connection it brought.  With this release of the Echo with smaller size and improved sound, I decided to upgrade.  For those in a situation like mine I highly recommend it!  I no longer worry about whether my alarms will come through audibly and the sound is a major improvement over the bluetooth speaker I was using.

Also some things that should be simple, like playing my audio book on all my speakers at once isn't possible. This seems silly because Bluetooth speakers with far less tech can do this, so why can't these super fancy computerized speakers do this basic function?

The newer versions like this one with fabric covers look great and I think make the sound better than the older non-fabric versions.  Have only used a few other basic functions so far, like asking for weather and such..though I did purchase a smart plug when Amazon had a deal and look forward to setting it up to control a lamp in my place but have not done so yet.  Only annoying thing is the notifications that come in and make the unit glow..though I am sure there is a way to turn this feature off.  Also, when you set an alarm it will go on at the volume the unit was set on..again, I am guessing this can be changed but for now continue to use my phone as alarm to wake me up...just need to play a little more with the features, but overall very pleased if I judge it as a speaker for music which was what I really wanted it for to replace an older bluetooth speaker which did not have great sound (but with the Echo, it is better placed in an open environment..which is not always easy with having to plug it in..but I found a place and it works well..)

The one caveat being the customer service which was somehow the worst I've ever gotten from Amazon, not to mention its Amazon's own product...Luckily I got everything fixed in the end, and am enjoying it.On the app front, it leaves plenty to be desired-* no ability to create alarm clocks manually, only edit existing omes* no ability to create recurring reminders* app seems to completely rely on an internet connection, so even while on the same wifi as the echo, every click takes a while to load.* list management is ok, but no Google keep integration.

Of course, both of them are miles better than the Dot.I also prefer the size and style of the new Echo; less obtrusive in my living room.IMO, if you're thinking of getting an Echo, don't be deterred by the bad reviews here.\\r\\n            \", 'I fell in love with the dot that I decided I needed a second echo, so after researching the echo and the echo plus, I decided to buy this one.

Plays games , recognizes your voice, sings to you , tells jokes , etc.....,, You get the idea soooo many things that it’s impossible to list .

Radio reception is terrible where I live, and the stations are worse. I have an old Bose Wave for serious listening.

It's also nice ordering someone around that isn't human!\\r\\n            \", 'General:- We purchased the Echo ($99) because we wanted the better speaker.  The music does sound nice.  We expect that general voice interaction would also be better.- I was told that Alexa uses the Yahoo search engine and not Google.  Makes sense since Google has a similar product.  The search ability seems fine.Setup:- As is usual with technology, the setup is a pain.- Alexa assumes that you have smartphone and use the app.  We have a Samsung S5 Android with current system patches.- I found the app to be unstable to log into.  Sometimes it would only accept part of the password and then just restart.  I did eventually get logged into the app and Alexa pulled the phone list.  If you can ever get logged, in the app sort of works.  This app response happened on both of our S5s so I do not think it is the phone - but you never know with phones.- I did spend 45 minutes on phone support, she had never seen this issue of self restarting.  We eventually gave up setting up Alexa from the phone and used the web site (alexa.amazon.com) and your Amazon logon.  That worked OK.  Once in, the basic setup via online is simple to link your WiFi (you need your WiFi password).  Laptop Web works easier since it is easier to put in a complex password via laptop than on the phone.  So I would use that for basic setup.- But if you want voice calling by name you need the app on the phone.  Alexa must automatically pull down your contacts/phone list.- I think Alexa pulls your contact list every time you login to app, so you need to re-login if your contacts change.  I did not find any documentation on this.- Alexa does not pull down your preferred phone number for a contact.  Alexa always uses the mobile number even though you have selected a preferred number in the phone.  I have not found a way around this.  I am still trying renaming the mobile number in the phone but no success.- You can voice call by saying the phone number.- I cannot identify any procedure that allows you to reliably log on to the app.  One time I got app to work by: uninstalling; power off phone; power on phone; re-install app; then I was able to login.Using Alexa:- Alexa basic is free with a basic Amazon account.  The basic account gives you the ability to ask questions and only a small amount of music.  Amazon prime gives you more music.  Full Amazon Music is $3.99 per month if you have Prime.  With a basic account Amazon Music is $9.99 per month.\\r\\n            ', \"I didn't know i needed this until my husband bought it for a Valentines Day gift. I actually made fun of friends that owned one as a fad item. But now I'm hooked.

She also played my Spotify Playlist today while I painted (PSA you must have a premium Spotify account to synch and I'm glad I had the excuse to subscribe) and she also told me a wierd fact today.

In terms of convenience, I use the Echo to make my mornings run smoother, by knowing the weather forecast, the time, and setting alarms and timers without having to touch my phone. This makes your daily routine much simpler and more efficient. Another convenient aspect of the Echo is that it is small enough that it can be placed anywhere, as long as it is near an outlet.I primarily use the Amazon Echo as a smart speaker so that I can listen to music hands-free when I do chores, cook, clean, and do homework.

The speaker is a good quality for the price point, and gets loud enough to be heard with more than 10 people speaking to each other in a room.

The Echo can call you an Uber, control your TV, blast your favorite music from Pandora or Spotify, and even open your garage door.Below is some of the criteria I’ve used to evaluate this product.Physical CharacteristicsDue to it being smaller in height than the 1st Generation, those who may want to conceal their Echo can do so easily. For example, it can be concealed behind a medium-sized picture frame of the same color and nobody will even know it is there. Leaving it out in the open is no problem either. It takes up minimal space and the charcoal fabric blends in or matches with most home décor.Like all Echos, the 2nd Generation does require a power cord for operation. It is several feet long and allows you to place your Echo where you want without having to do much reorganization. Different from the 1st Generation, this Echo has volume buttons instead of the rotating head control. Having the buttons gives the user more options for volume levels if they choose to manually control the device.Sound Quality and Voice CommandsIf you like to play your music loud, then this is the device for you. A single 2nd Generation Echo can be heard clearly anywhere in a 2,000 square foot home without sacrificing the rich vocals from your favorite songs. For those times when you just want to ask Alexa a question; her audio will be clear and articulate.Controlling Alexa with voice commands is simple. Say her name and the top of the Echo will light up to show she is listening. At times, the device will pick up incorrect audio and Alexa will try to communicate with you. When this happens, you can tell her to stop or choose to ignore her question. Regardless, it isn’t frequent enough to be a nuisance.The 2nd Generation Echo was an excellent purchase; at a fair price.

Now we just ask Alexa to tell \"Tile\" to ring whatever we can\\'t find... it works fantastic. It\\'s also connected to our Eufi robovac and to some of our lights.

I have 2 full stereos complete with subs,  but sometimes I just want to listen to music without critically listening.  This is where the echo shines.  Bass is actually pretty good for being the fact that it is fairly small.  But if you are a bass head you won't be impressed.  The build quality seems to be good also.  The best part for me though is the ability to play virtually any music I want just by asking and have it actually sound pretty good.

I had trouble setting mine up with my note 8, but I have a tablet and was able to use it.

I started asking Alexa all sorts of stuff and I had so much fun with.  It sits on a ledge between my dining room and kitchen, but I can ask her anything from just about anywhere in my home and she responds.  I LOVE that she is interactive with me and my family but that she also has a voice recognition feature that tailors her to my commands.  I have Alexa synced with my IPhone so she can inform me of my calendar appointments.  She adds items to the shopping list so that I simply have to go to the Alexa App on my phone to retrieve the information when I’m out at the grocery store.  She plays all the music I want to hear and if it’s too loud and my hands are covered in batter, I simply say “Alexa lower the music” and she takes it down a notch without losing where the music was playing.  I’ve also enjoyed having her tell the children bedtime stories and playing a fun game on our family nights.  I’ve asked her the weather and she tells me my local area (not like some other AI’s and I won’t say any names:).

I have them around the house and grouped to play music throughout the house.I gave the echoes 4 stars for now because I feel that Alexa could be better at speech recognition and responses, better with supporting more than just basic commands such as on, off, and level.I know that Amazon is continually enhancing the echo features.

I’ve moved it a few times and it just re-establishes connection and doesn’t require the WiFi password entered again.

I am reviewing not only the device (Echo) but the interface (Alexa). Mainly useful for playing music, IMHO -- sound quality is truly great btw -- but drawback is the interface often doesn\\'t recognize made-up words or words with alternative spellings, which are common in musical songs and albums. For example, while it lists the Devin Townsend Project album Z2 correctly as Z-squared, it can\\'t seem to find it when one asks it to play. Another -- \"Apocalypto\" is the title of an old Motels album, and again Alexa could list it, but seems unable to play it. (Workaround - manually create playlists with Alexa-recognizable names.)I have yet to get the interface to add anything to My Music through verbal command, yet this is something it should be able to do. I find the ability to create playlists via verbal commands to be annoyingly slow, much easier to use the app. I have had similar difficulties accessing order details, get a lot of \"I\\'m not sure what went wrong\" answers.Regardless of these inconveniences, the Echo and Alexa do an incredible job given the short time the device/interface has existed.

I highly recommend the Alexa for simple uses such as playing music to more advanced control options of your daily life automation setups.\\r\\n            ', \"The 2nd Generation Echo is about the equivalent as the original version, accept I liked the way the older one had a volume control wheel at the top. The new one only has up and down buttons, which you can't see if you have your Echo setting on a shelf higher than your shoulders. With the original version, if you want to raise the volume you can simply reach up and twist the top one way or the other. With the new one I have to ask Alexa to raise or lower the volume, which takes a few iterations before you get the volume at the level you want. If it were me, and the 1st Generation Echo's were still available, I would buy one of those before I bought one of these new ones.\\r\\n            \", 'I use this Echo to listen to music, to get weather updates, to turn on the lights, to remind me to take a break, to time an activity, to give me positive affirmations and wonderful compliments, to alert me when packages are delivered, and to tell me jokes.  I know there is much more that can be done as well.  I have to say that Alexa is a very friendly voice and almost sounds like a human.  My son asked my 4 year old granddaughter who Alexa is.  She said, \"Alexa is not a real person, she is a robot.\"  The same granddaughter asks for dance music, gives thumbs up to the songs she likes, and can move on to the next song if she doesn\\'t like one all with voice command.  She said that she is my Alexa teacher.  This was a wonderful gift from my daughter\\'s family at Christmas.  The sound quality is quite remarkable.  There are many more links that I haven\\'t tried yet.  Pretty soon she will be going with me in the car.  Siri, are you listening?  You could learn a few things from Alexa!\\r\\n            ', \"I waited a long time to buy an Echo because I wasn't sure if it would become a fad and I'd get bored quickly.  I've had this for a few weeks now and totally love it.  I especially like the shopping list and reminders.  Alexa also plays all the music I love.  The sound quality is very good and loud.  I'm hearing impaired so I was concerned about volume.  It is loud enough for me to hear easily.  I'm having a good time with it and look forward to exploring more features.\\r\\n            \", 'Fun niffy gadget.  Good music sound, weather reports and news briefing.  Set up a few smart plugs and be able to turn on and off lights with a vocal command. I would like to see some changes for example, being able to add music to my morning \"\" routine\"\" and be able to control my Directv via Echo but overall a great product.  I also believe the Alexa App needs some work.  When I set up a shopping list ( which I have three for three different errands ) I sometimes need to reboot my phone to get access to the list when at the store.  Again, a minor complaint. This may be a good gift for friends and family in the future.\\r\\n            ', 'I exchanged the echo plus for this because it was less expensive and I did not need the hub feature on the plus.  After set up; everything works as expected.  I also found that the sound on this echo was a bit better than the echo plus.  However, it could be just personal taste. When comparing, the second generation echo was less \"tinny\" with higher pitched music.  Very excited and want to order another for Christmas!\\r\\n            ', 'I received this as a gift,  and I couldn\\'t be happier.  I love the option to change my music preference, search weather, traffic etc.  You can even play games on the Echo.

It\\'s also a compact and attractive device, and quite useful for playing just about anything you want.However, once I got some radio station and I said, \"Play X, but no commercials.\" I got the same radio station. And again. And again....And I guess Alexa herself is better, but \"better\" is relative. She was playing a Christmas song being covered by someone other than who I was used to, so I asked her to play someone else singing that song. She didn\\'t have a clue. Well, it is fun to ask her random questions, but don\\'t get your hopes up!\\r\\n            ', 'GREAT BUY AFTER THE UPDATE:  I received my Echo 2nd Gen on the first day of release with great expectations.  After setting the unit up, like many, I was disappointed  in the sound quality.  I have purchased two Echo Gen 1 for family members and I am very familiar with the sound.  The Echo Gen 2 fell short of the highly advertised better sound quality of the 1st Gen.  However, after the update, which downloaded automatically, I am very impressed with the unit..  Thanks to Amazon for quickly addressing this issue.  I have absolutely no reservations in giving it a 5 star rating.\\r\\n            ', 'Besides the fact that my 2nd Generation Echo functions so well, the compatibility has been flawless. It\\'s been like 2 weeks and I\\'ve already connected a smart bulb in my bedroom, a smart plug in my living room, linked my Fire TV. It\\'s better than I could\\'ve hoped. Besides that I got the Smart Plug from Amazon for $4 after a $20 promo code for simply adding it to my cart via the Echo.. Earlier tonight I was browsing for slippers, while checking the various colors I realized that I got a $10 Alexa discount. It just doesn\\'t stop giving. I\\'ve put a new 3rd Generation Dot in my son\\'s room, linked his Fire TV another in the living room.. my Granddaughter controls her Fire Stick, controls the lights with the Smart Plug, orders up SpongeBob off Prime with the Dot. I tried to help a friend with the setup of a few Google devices and it was a nightmare.. nothing but problems with the setup. I\\'m very happy, to tell you the truth I had some reservations about walking into my room talking to \"Alexa\" this imaginary voice.. felt ridiculous.. But I\\'m in, I turn my bedroom light on and off, pause my tv every time I leave the room. This is an honest 5 star recommendation. They got it right\\r\\n            ', \"I was hesitant about purchasing this item because I just didn't know how much benefit I would get out of this, but during the holiday sales I decided to splurge and ordered one.  This thing is amazing! So glad I bought one.  Not only do we use it to play music (which the sound is wonderful), we get traffic, weather, jokes, games and my children ask Alexa a multitude of questions.  She has been helpful in many ways and she has a sense of humor which we appreciate after a long day of work.\\r\\n            \", \"I have the first generation Echo and the newer version does sound better. The sound is a bit more clearer and the bass a bit more punchier than the original. The microphones seem to pick up a little bit better than the original also. nothing earth shattering here other just some general improvements on the hardware. If you have the original echo I'm not sure you really need to upgrade to the new one they both work well. I bought the new echo and paired it in my living room with my old one and now it has a really nice stereo sound in the room so it  was a nice pickup for me.\\r\\n            \", 'Amazon Echo is a great device (I was one of the first to have one and waiting for months for my first Echo to ship as Amazon vastly underestimated the demand for a device like this) and this Echo (2nd generation) is a good upgrade from the original. There is no volume ring on the 2nd gen Echo like there is on the original Echo and the 1st gen Echo Dot but it\\'s no big deal as there are volume buttons now and the cost of the volume ring wasn\\'t worth it if you ask me (it was nice, but for most people not worth the money). Most of the time you\\'ll want to adjust the volume by voice anyway (like \"Alexa volume 5\"). I actually prefer the cheaper volume buttons on the Dot 2 to the volume ring now.The fact that you can just talk from across the room and it can hear you (most of the time) really sets this apart. If you think you already have an Echo because you have Siri, Cortana, or Google, then know that it\\'s just not the same.Things I do: set timers, set alarms, get weather info, ask basic questions, listen to music (like Prime Music, Prime Stations, songs I bought, etc), listen to radio, ask for jokes, turn things on and off, and I\\'m sure I\\'m forgetting some things. The Echo really excels at playing music. I love it than I can ask for a song I want to hear and it will play it (most of the time anyway). At night I often listen to a local radio station and I just say \"Alexa stop\" without having to get out of bed when I want to stop listening. If you have multiple Echos then you can set up a music group and play the music through all of the Echos in the music group at the same time so you can play music throughout the entire house or just downstairs or wherever you want. UPDATE: I\\'ve ran into some bugs/issues with some Echos in a music group not playing music with the rest of the group so that\\'s unfortunate.When I listen to Prime Station I can tell it \"thumbs up\" if I like the song or \"thumbs down\" if I don\\'t... and when I listen to the station again it won\\'t play the songs that I\\'ve thumbed down.Using the built-in speaker, the sound quality is quite good for the size and price. A big plus is the addition of an AUX output compared to the 1st gen Echo. I somewhat wish I could AirPlay to a device from the Echo when I\\'m playing music and want the best sound quality, however Bluetooth is pretty impressive when it uses the near-CD quality codecs.Positives:* I like the form factor better than the 1st gen - it\\'s shorter and a little wider but feels quite substantial and has a great non-skid rubber or rubber-like base.* The somewhat feature that Amazon added (ESP - Echo Spatial Perception) so that the nearest Echo responds is fantastic. Unfortunately there does seem to be a minor downside: the Echo\\'s response can sometimes be slightly delayed while multiple Echoes figure out which Echo is closest and should respond.* It seems to hear better when playing music than the first gen. It was annoying when you would try to talk to it while it was playing but it couldn\\'t hear you. The new Echo hears better during music playback but it\\'s still not \"Star Trek quality\" hearing; sometimes you may still need to raise your voice.* It\\'s a good buy at the regular asking price and a better buy than the 1st gen Echo.* It has a 3.5mm stereo audio jack. Sound quality through this jack should be good enough for anyone except audiophiles.* Works great and stays connected to my\\xa0Asus RT-AC68U\\xa0router.* If you want to \\'Wikipedia\\' something then you can say \\'Alexa, Wikipedia <subject>\\'. She\\'ll read a little from Wikipedia. If you want her to read more after she stops then just say \\'Alexa, tell me more\\'. This can be useful sometimes.Negatives (mostly minor but take note):* While trying out Amazon Music Unlimited with the Echo I immediately ran into the issue of the Echo playing the explicit version of songs instead of the clean version. There should be an option to never play explicit songs and to play the clean version instead (some people have children). The workaround until Amazon addresses this problem is to add the clean song to your music library and then say \"Alexa play <song> from my library\".* The Android Amazon Alexa app can be slow and frustrating sometimes. There seems to be opportunity for speed improvement here.* The Android app has frustrating editing of text and does not allow you to tap the text in order to place the cursor for editing. I was trying to leave some feedback and needed to go back and edit but I cannot edit anything without deleting everything back to the point where I want to edit. Kind of ridiculous and very frustrating. The iOS app also suffers from this frustration (actually it seems you can get around it in iOS by holding your finger down but why are they making editing text so difficult?).* If you have lights in multiple rooms and Echos in multiple rooms then you might think that you could say \"turn on the lights\" and it would turn the lights on in that particular room based on which Echo heard the command... but alas, it does not seem possible to do this. You have to name the lights differently, like \"study light\" and say \"turn on the study light\". It\\'s too bad you can\\'t just say \"turn on the lights\" in the study and it will turn on the study lights because the Echo that is in the study heard the command.* Doesn\\'t hear well in a noisy environment, or when other people (including on TV) are talking at the same time.Home Automation:* I use several\\xa0Belkin WeMo\\xa0switches to control some lights and fans. They work pretty well although not always perfectly. I also recently added a Philips Hue system as well.* I can control my Honeywell WiFi thermostats using the \"Honeywell Total Connect Comfort\" skill. I have two downstairs for 2 zones. I have one\\xa0Honeywell RTH9580WF1005/W1\\xa0and one\\xa0Honeywell RTH6580WF.* I recently set it up to turn on and off certain activities with a\\xa0Logitech Smart Hub. For example, I can say \"Alexa, turn on TiVo\" and it will turn on the TV and my receiver and set the TV and receiver inputs correctly. I can then use the remote which is synced... and turn it all off with \"Alexa turn off TiVo\". There were some annoyances getting it all setup but I think it\\'s pretty \"cool\" even though you can only start and stop activities with Alexa so you still need the remote to do other things (change channel, adjust volume, mute, pause, etc).* I think I\\'ve only really scratched the surface of what is possible with home automation. I have not tried IFTTT (\"if this then that\") recipes yet but I hear it is quite powerful and hope to try it out when I have more time to \"play\".Wishes:* High-quality digital audio output that is better than Bluetooth. If it had this then you could really get high quality audio output from it, but most people probably don\\'t really care that much as analog out is \"good enough\".* Smarter. After 2 years I wish the Echo was smarter. Yes, it has definitely improved over time but Google can still answer more questions than Alexa. It\\'s going to be hard to beat Google in answering general questions.* Severe weather alerts. I suggested these alerts a long time ago and they still haven\\'t added it to my knowledge... perhaps due to legal reasons? If would be great if it would sound some sort of alarm or notification for severe weather.* Built-in support for notifying others that you might need help. This would be good for the elderly. There is a \"Ask My Buddy\" skill however, but the verbiage is a little awkward (\"Alexa, Ask My Buddy to Send Help\") and it\\'s free so if the developer decides to stop support then that might leave a lot of people without service at an inopportune time.Compared to Google Home:* Setup on Google Home was super-simple, easier than Echo (the Android app worked really well and setup seemed streamlined)* Google Home is smarter for general questions... significantly smarter. I asked Google \"How long does it take to get to the Honda dealer in Lewisville\" and it told me about 26 minutes in current traffic conditions. Awesome. The Echo totally failed here.* No AUX audio output like on Echo Dot* I prefer saying \"Alexa\" to \"OK Google\" or \"Hey Google\"* I currently prefer Echo for music and smart home control but I consider Google Home a serious threat to Echo because it is more \"intelligent\" than EchoOther:* It doesn\\'t come with a 3.5mm audio cable but I can understand why as many people would probably not use it and Amazon wants to get the cost as low as possible so this isn\\'t a big deal.* About 10 or 15 minutes after setting it up, it said something like \"your Echo received an important update and must restart\". So if you are having issues with it then you may want to give it awhile so it can update if needed.* For better understanding of what you say, go to the Alexa app and Settings->Voice Training.While not perfect, I really like the Amazon Echo. I think the technology and potential is still in its infancy but the Echo is already really useful and excels at home automation, playing music, podcasts, and radio. I\\'m giving it 4 stars due to Google Home being much smarter at answering general questions and due to the negatives I\\'ve mentioned above. The Echo is a good device but I think you should also seriously consider Google Home, or maybe even both like I have.\\r\\n            ', \"Love everything about the Echo! It makes me feel safe because I know I can get help very easily if I need medical assistance. Also great because my husband can't hear well and doesn't talk on the phone or remember phone numbers of our children. He can get help easily by talking. I also love the drop in feature. I now have my shopping list with me at all times since I record my needs on the Store List feature. Also use the tell me a joke feature.

I have use it daily since it arrived. The sound quality was always enough that I could hear the music but couldn't really pick up a while lot of detail and the low end frequency was really missing. Also, it didn't blend in with the living room decor, so it seemed to stick out a bit.The 2nd gen. has made big improvements to both. The Echo delivers cleaner, fuller sound while at the same time bringing enough low end to get really good all-around sound from a single speaker. The shorter wider profile along with the fabric cover make it fit in about anywhere in the living room. Microphone sensitivity and range is about the same as the original. The only negative thing I could say about it is I wish it still had the ring for volume adjustment. It made it easier to turn down after one of the kids had been listening to their music at near full volume or adjusting to just the right level for listening to music when company is over. Not that you can't do it by voice command, or the buttons on top of the new version, just a personal preference.Overall, I love it.

There are many different actions that the Echo can perform that make life easier.The criteria I used in my evaluation of the Amazon Echo include: sound quality, assistant quality, and overall appearance.You can use the Echo, not only as a virtual assistant, but as a high quality Bluetooth speaker.  The sound quality is good, and includes a great downward facing sub that produces a rich sound profile.  The speaker sounds great for any genre of music, and is loud enough to fill an entire room.  Though, the speaker is only part of what makes the Echo great.The Amazon Echo has the best virtual assistant, Alexa.  Alexa is by far better than any other virtual assistant on the market.  It is a very accurate and easy to understand. It has a wide array of accepted commands, and is very helpful in making your day easier.  My favorite feature would have to be the ability to set alarms for the following day, entirely with your voice.  On top of that, it works with a large amount of third-party devices and applications.  This network of third-party devices far exceeds that of any other voice assistant.The design of the 2nd Generation Echo is very aesthetically pleasing.  Compared to the 1st generation, the 2nd generation echo had a much stronger focus on design.  I personally ordered the Charcoal Fabric Echo; however, there is a design that would fit almost anyone’s taste.  The fabric does a great job covering the, in my opinion, obnoxious speaker holes on the side of the device.  I also appreciate the overall size reduction of the 2nd Generation Echo.Overall, I would highly recommend the 2nd Generation Amazon Echo. For the price, you can’t get any other virtual assistant that comes close to this quality.\\r\\n            ', 'Amazon Echo- 2nd generationI would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a tool that will help them stay organized, entertained, and informed. This product is great for listening to music/audiobooks, making lists, setting alarms, and providing news and weather updates.  The Amazon Echo is simple to set up and compatible with a variety of apps on your smartphone. Amazon music, Pandora, Spotify, allrecipies, and ecobee are just some of the skills the echo is able to utilize. This review will evaluate the following three criteria to help you make an informed decision if this product is capable of enhancing your life.FeaturesThe Amazon Echo comes with a variety of features that will help anyone stay organized, informed, and entertained. The Alexa app allows users to conveniently link their apps to the speaker with ease. The manufacturer recommends buying amazon music for a low monthly price which gives you access to unlimited music. If you are looking for free music Pandora is an excellent option. The echo allows you to stay connected by syncing your contacts, so you can use it as a device for calling. With Bluetooth connection any device can use the speaker to amplify their music or videos. The Echo is great for checking the weather, setting alarms, and comes with a built in Jeopardy game. With home adapters the echo also is able to control your thermostat, lights, and television.UsabilityThe Echo is extremely user friendly. For set up, the device comes with step by step instructions. Once you have the Echo set up the possibilities are endless. For best use make sure the Echo is in the center of room and away from any televisions or radios. This allows for the device to clearly and effectively communicate with you. In order to receive the most out of your product internet access is vital. It is also recommended that users have smartphones as this allows for the most effective management and usability. As stated earlier, the Amazon Echo can help you with all your entertainment, communication, and organizational needs.DesignThe second-generation Echo is designed to look great in any home. The variety of colors give the owner the ability to match it to their surroundings. The speaker has been upgraded in this version for a clear and crisp sound. The Echo is fit with a ring of lights that make communication clear and effective for all users. There are buttons on the top that make it clear to the user how to change the volume, mute the speaker, and initiate communication.I hope this review has been helpful in your purchasing decision.\\r\\n            ', \"Great.

I can control all of my Phillips Hue lighting systems with voice control.CONS - My only major gripe with this product is that you are limited on the music apps that are compatible with the device.

You must tell it to dial a specific number (alexa, dial 603 572 1455) as it does not access your entire list of contacts at this time so you cannot generally dial by name.Much still needs to be worked out with Alexa/Echo and other voice control systems.  The organization of the 'skills' is haphazard and the skills (app equivalents) themselves are mostly pretty lame or uneven.  You cannot give more than one command at a time (for example, 'Alexa, turn off the kitchen and bathroom light') and you can't intuitively get answers to many questions (for example, what channel is the basketball game on) without referencing other skills and or adhering to a very specific lexicon.  I assume and hope that this will all improve with time as Amazon and others figure out how folks are really using these devices. Frustratingly, Amazon refuses to use Google for its searches and an Alexa search is always on Bing-- not the best.Nevertheless, I find with use that I like having Alexa around and this new (snd)generation is both less expensive and just as good as the original Echo released 3 years ago, It seems as though Alexa will wind up being built into many devices in your home and will become ubiquitous eventually rather than being a cylinder in just a few rooms.

The downside is there are so many, it\\'s hard to weed out the good from the bad, let alone remember the commands to open them. Alexa sometimes suggests a skill, and I think that is a step in the right direction in the development of the AI.If you were looking for a Siri or Google Assistant that could answer all sorts of questions and search the internet for you, the Echo has a way to go.

While my Bose Soundlink Mini II bluetooth speaker has a very slight edge in the bass department, the Echo sounds pretty darn great.  For those who say the sound is weak, they are way too picky about the capability of this speaker.  First off, I would say this thing sounds better than other $50-80 speakers and they don't have Alexa.  Secondly, use your surroundings to enhance the bass.  Set the device near a wall or some other object where the sound can bounce off.  Even my Bose speaker sounds better when I set it near a wall.  In our kitchen, we have set it on one of the counters on the side.  If you place it on your island with nothing else around it, the bass will seem weaker.  This is just acoustics and not the fault of the speaker.For the Alexa side of it, we are enjoying the features so far.  We plan on getting more smart devices to connect to it but streaming music (Pandora, Amazon Music) and adding items to a shared shopping list on our phones has been flawless.

The replacements work great. I am keeping my rating at four stars for now because the quality of the audio and ease of use is great on the replacement devices and definitely deserve the four stars.I bought three of the 2nd generation Echo's as Christmas gifts. I saw the setting up of two of the units and I did notice some differences between the two. One device set up quickly and easily but the second device kept on constantly dropping the internet connection and thus would not respond when given simple instructions or asked simple questions.After looking through the support pages and spending some time on the phone with customer support, the issue continued so I initiated an exchange. The replacement echo arrived within one day which was nice since I was still in the process of shipping back the failed unit. The replacement Echo that arrived was able to be set up quickly and easily and works perfectly. Interestingly though, the new device seems more responsive than the first Echo that was initially set up. The first Echo is sitting in the living room and the second (new) device is about twenty feet away up the stairs on the second floor. When we give a command to the device in the living room, the Echo on the second floor often responds before the Echo in the living room. This is not a big deal but does show a slight difference between the two devices. I'm impressed by how both Echo's are able to hear commands even when spoken to softly.So far, we've used the Echo's for basic tasks like playing music from Spotify or Sirius radio, and basic questions such as the weather or for definitions of words. They have worked great for those purposes.In the future, we plan on incorporation a few smart devices to expand what we can do with the units.The only thing that I think would make the Echo better would be to add the ability to play sound out of both the Echo and an additional speaker at the same time while connected via Bluetooth. Currently, we can easily add a Bluetooth speaker but it will only play sound out of the connected speaker and not both the speaker and the Echo at the same time.All in all, the Echo's are nice devices with very good sound for such small devices.\\r\\n            \", 'What a wonderful experience so far!

If you signed up for the amazon.com store card they\\'d give you an instant $40 gift card credit, along with 5% cash back on each purchase. Well that meant I could buy three and only pay for two.

Turned on the alexa app on my iphone 6 and followed the instructions for getting her communicating through my home\\'s wifi. Initially the software seemed to have trouble recognizing my very long password (note: never use anything less than a 26 hexadecimal password.) After a restart she hooked up on the first try.My wife, son, and I began asking some of the suggested questions, and so far so good. We\\'ve had fun with the jokes, and I enjoy how the system integrates with our calendar app. Most importantly though, was how Alexa sounded. Compared to the Google Home...WOW!! I have two very high end systems in my home. My ears are very sensitive to differences in quality between speaker types and tonality. Whereas the Google Home, with its single speaker element sounded flat and muffled, the Echo\\'s two element system sounds very bright and airy, with as much bass as you could expect from such a small package, and the highs are clear, not muddy at all. The Echo gets louder too, with much more headroom at the higher volume levels. The Echo is a very balanced little gem. I have no problem listening to the Echo for a short period if I just want some ambient music in the background. It is not going to match the Sonos, but then again it also costs much less.We have one upstairs, one on the main floor in the kitchen, and one in the basement. It\\'s nice to be able to use them as intercom units. We can \"drop in\" on our son and his friends in the basement if we need to talk to them, or my wife can talk to me without having to yell from the kitchen or upstairs if I am busy downstairs or in the basement.Alexa does have limitations and I can only hope the techies are working on them. My biggest gripe is that Alexa does not recognize the phrase \\'top pop clean\\' when I want to listen to that particular station. Or any other \\'clean\\' stations for that matter. You see, I am absolutely disgusted with the lyrics in many of todays new music tracks. I\\'m not sure what changed to allow music to be published or broadcast with all the f-bombs you hear nowadays (with the exception of \"Who Are You\") but as long as there are people ignorant enough to buy that sort of trash, there will be a market for it. My point here is the programmers need to make the minor change to recognize when the word \\'clean\\' follows a known Amazon Music station Alexa should check the database for a [blank blank (clean)] option and either play it or come back with \"there is no option for a clean version of [blank blank] station. Should I play it anyway?\"Using Alexa to play Pandora stations does not seem to have the above limitation.Overall am very happy with the purchase. I really should only give it a four star rating due to the f-bombs we heard during testing of Amazon Music radio stations. Otherwise it\\'s definitely a five star product! I may get an echo dot or two for complete whole home coverage of audio.**UPDATE**  This morning, Dec. 6, I asked once again, \"Alexa, play my Top Pop CLEAN station\". Lo and behold! She recognized it! She responded, \"playing your Top Pop CLEAN station.\" Awesome.

Lets be honest straight from the off here, this is a sub $100 speaker, and in my honest opinion it out performs its price tag in this field. is it as good a Bose or Sonos.....NO but why would you buy this thinking that in the first place. The Echo produces a nice warm rich sound with some noticeable base that will please most average users who aren\\'t trying to wake up the neighborhood. More of a dinner party device than a house party, although the volume is quite surprisingly loud. I would rate this as a 8/10Music integration with Alexa. Maybe she needs a little bit of work here. I saved playlists and when asking her to play them she sometimes just plays stations from amazon music that\\'s is similar rather than the actual playlist. Now i must state im British and have Alexa set to american English so I have now changed that to UK to see if she understands me better - fingers crossed. 5/10 so farSmart home. I have been using TP-Link bulbs with the KASA app and it works perfectly - super easy to set up in the Alexa app and between the 2 systems im super happy. 9/10 (nothings a 10 right?)Improvements to Alexa.......Volume profiles - It would be good to have Alexa voice volume and music volume separate. can be annoying later in the day when you talk to her and the voice is shouting at you.Multiple commands - Asking her to do more than one thing at once. sometimes I want to turn the lounge lights on and turn them to a certain profile. you can say alexa do this and alexa do that, or alexa play this and alex turn volume up, and sometimes it works but most of the time it doesnt. Thats a bit of a pain.Stay listening longer. So i ask a question and she says \"sorry I dont know that one\" - not very helpful so I want to ask it again so she understands but she has gone sleep again so i have to say Alexa to wake her. now this starts being a right pain after you want her to do multiple things and she gets them wrong as you can end up saying Alexa 10 times in the space of a minute and that gets super annoying to the point I go over to the echo and press the button so i don\\'t have to say Alexa again. Why cant she be programmed to say \"anything else i can help with\" and wait, after she doesn\\'t understand a command instead of going sleep. pretty easy fix i think.Overall though I was pleased I brought the Echo and have since brought 2 Dots for added smart home functionality.

I followed up by purchasing an Amazon Echo and Harmony Hub for my Home Theater/AV Equipment.

Once you purchase an Echo I encourage you to keep an eye on the Amazon \"Skills\" because that is where you will find even more useful capabilities.

I own 1 first gen dot and two echos and this has 50% increased in volume from the original little echo and is a legitimate music player. It is a little less basey and clear than the 1st gen original echo in side by side comparison but not too noticeable where it’d really matter because it’s still half the price and looks waaaay better. That’s the second best thing is the style really is something that looks premium and high quality and blends into any space. With the selection of colors it’s a great option for any room or environment and fits better than the 1st gen dot or echo and isn’t an eye sore.I’m definitely buying another soon for $79 that’s a great deal and the performance it gives in comparison to the echo is worth the price especially with how much more eye friendly and stylish it is.Pros: 1) Price,2) Far louder and better sound than 1st gen dot3) Sound quality is great, bugs are fixed4) very stylish and looks greatCons:1) little less crisp, clear and basey than the original echoOpinion: this is a great investment. It’s waaay better than the original dot. It’s a legitimate speaker and great for bedroom or living room, especially in an apartment or smaller room it will fill it up. However, I’d invest in an echo or even better, a designated speaker designed for music if your looking something exclusively for music for a larger space or for those who want a premium quality for listening as bose/other brands have better sound playing devices for $100 price range and then just use the dot/echo for your lights, information and commands.\\r\\n            ', 'This was the best gift that I got for Christmas!

I thought the critique was quite picky. Now I have the Echo 2nd generation on my nightstand and I can tell you it is a huge irritant that should be fixed, hopefully through software upgrades.  So one is left  to set volumes i.e. Volumes 1 - 10.  Herein is the rub!  Volume 1 is so low it is completely unintelligible  and cannot be heard while Volume 2 is entirely too loud for trying to go to sleep or reading. The volume ring is gone  so now  you have to try to find the volume up and volume down buttons on the top  and this often  in dim light.  For discriminating listeners this is easily apparent.  If you're only getting weather reports, making shopping list, turn lights on, and doing a myriad of other utilitarian  tasks which do not require fine night time or arm chair listening then this volume irritant will go unnoticed. But let this be a warning to others who choose to put it on the nightstand and hope far music to go to sleep by or to even read with. Amazon, if you're reading this, please bring up Volume 1 a little so that it can be heard and bring down Volume 2 so that it is truly in the background. How about this Amazon, if you're reading this, allow us to change volume by voice to 1 and 1.5, or volume 2 and 2.5. If there is going to be such a disparity between volume 1 and volume 2 then allow the customer to have a halfway point between each volume.\\r\\n            \", 'Not normally an issue, but, way too much bass.

Firstly it is excellent because it is relatively impervious to location in a room. You can place it in a corner or in the center of a room and you have a consistent listening experience. The speakers are expertly tuned to provide a great listening experience for 99% of people without them having to be an audio enthusiast. But this is also it's source of contention. People compare it to directional Bluetooth speakers, but this comparison cannot be made. Directional speakers have a much easier time of producing sound because they only broadcast in, you guessed it, a single direction. But directional speakers also have their quirks, such as only sounding good when they are pointed directly at you, let's have any negative reviewer turn their comparator Bluetooth speaker around and compare them that way!All in all, echo provides what I would determine as a 6/10 listening experience. 10 being $4k iems, 1 being children's toys.

She doesn't know everything, so it can be a little frustrating when she doesn't know something that you think she should.

I was going to get another Dot but decided to take advantage of the deal of buying the package of a Echo and an Echo Dot for only $100. Was a $50 savings. The sound is really a big upgrade to the Dot.\\r\\n            ', 'Overall, the Echo is an excellent product to add to your home. When I heard about the Echo back in 2014, I was very skeptical someone could come up with something useful for it to do unless you were entrenched in the Smart Home world. Fast forward three years, and I currently own two Echo Dots and a regular Echo. As long as you like music and even occasionally search the internet or set a timer, you will enjoy the Echo.Things I like:First off, when I was reading reviews trying to decide if I was going to purchase an Echo or get a Dot and a speaker, I read a lot of reviews that slammed the new Echo for poor sound quality. I personally have not noticed any issues. It has a good amount of bass, and music sounds good at almost any volume level. Is it a $500 home stereo system? No, but it\\'s more than competent. for most music listeners. While you can buy a Dot and a speaker, I wouldn\\'t recommend it simply because the Echo is a much more streamlined and attractive way to listen to music.I own an iPhone, and as pretty much everyone knows, Siri isn\\'t exactly the smartest assistant out there. I can\\'t compare it to the Google Assistant, but I can say that Alexa is more than competent. There are only a couple of times where she hasn\\'t had an answer for what I\\'m looking for, but overall, she pretty much has a good answer. It\\'s kind of silly, but one of my favorite things are her jokes. They\\'re always a punny kind of funny, and it\\'s one of those ways that Amazon made sure Alexa seems like a natural part of your home. The only thing Amazon should add to the Echo is the ability to search using Bing. I say Bing because Google uses its own search engine for its Home speakers, so Amazon will have to turn somewhere else for searches. Right now, the functionality is missing (as far as I know,) so adding at least some ability to search would put the Echo that much further ahead of the Google Home.If you get an Echo, you will more than likely get some form of smart home device. When I bought my 3rd Echo, I got an offer to buy a TP-Link mini plug for $10. I took the plunge and now use it to control the lamp next to my bed. Overall, Echo integration works well and makes lighting even more convenient. My favorite thing is the routines, where you can tell Alexa a catchphrase and she will do several things at once. For example, I have it set so that when I wake up, I say \"Alexa, good morning,\" and she will turn on the lights and begin my flash briefing. It\\'s really a slick process that you don\\'t realize how much you\\'ll use it until you have it in your home.Things that need work:BY FAR, the biggest con for Echo users is the Alexa app, at least on iOS. Setting up my Echo, it couldn\\'t connect to my home Wifi network and failed three times. I had to use my phone as a hotspot and then come back in about an hour to connect it to my Wifi network. When I\\'m trying to pause music on the Alexa app, it usually won\\'t actually pause the music. It\\'s not necessarily huge things that ruin the Alexa app, but it\\'s the sum of the little glitches that make it frustrating at least.The multi-room music works most of the time, but if one of the Echos gets turned off, it messes the entire thing up.The way Amazon has set up the households is annoying as well, mainly with relation to smart home. If you add a smart home device to one account, it won\\'t automatically sync with the other accounts attached to your Echo, meaning you have to manually add each skill, smart device, and routine to each account. I get why skills and music doesn\\'t transfer between the two, but really Amazon? If we\\'re in the same house, we are going to use the same smart home devices. Please fix!The smart home section of the app could use some beefing up. Mainly, I want the ability to tell a group of lights to turn off at sunrise, on at sunset through the Alexa app. Can I do it through the individual apps of each device? Yes, but it would be a lot more convenient to be able to take care of it all through the Alexa app.Overall, I really do enjoy my Echo. The positives more than outweigh the negatives. If you\\'ve been wondering whether or not you are going to buy one for a while, take the plunge, especially with the $20 off deal going on right now. You won\\'t regret it.\\r\\n            ', 'This item is a fun thing to have around, but if you are really serious about optimizing its use, be prepared to spend a lot more money (or already have all of the home security, lighting, wall switches, etc) that the Echo is built to work with.

      "['I hate this generation of echo. First generation we have works great, no issues whatsoever. This one, however, has given us issues right from the get-go.- Drops connection all.the.time.  We have four other echos in the house, not a problem with any of them (unless our network really does go down). And this echo literally is in the same location as where we previously had our fist gen that gave us no problems, so it’s not about proximity to our router. I decided to replace the first gen with this one to have a more appealing aesthetic with the grey fabric since it’s in our great room and highly visible.- Stops playing music randomly. All.the.time. Again, non-issue with all other devices in the house. No, it’s not someone “stealing” Spotify from this device to play on their device. It just stops playing. Sometimes after 15 songs, sometimes after two songs. When I’ve requested a particular radio station, it certainly has more than two songs, so....- Volume control issues. We turn it up about 2/3 of the way to have a decent volume experience to hear music. No, we’re not jamming out to music, this is a nice “preparing dinner and dining” level experience. Yet, when Alexa speaks or someone drops in on this particular device, we can’t hear her. We have to turn the volume up to almost 100%. Half way is perfect on the first gen and there are no volume inequalities between music and Alexa speaking with that device.- Alexa has issues hearing us and responding to us. It’s frustrating to have to ask her four separate times what the forecast is before she acknowledges our request. Other devices? No issue. Surprise.I hate this device and tried returning it as defective months ago, but Amazon forces you to troubleshoot with them first. I don’t have time for that and there really is nothing to troubleshoot. My husband is an IT director, he is very technically savvy, we have no issues with our other devices, this device is a lemon. Finally just swapped it out for our first gen so we can have reliable use again in our most-used space.\\r\\n            ', 'We loved having the Echo, even bought one for the kids and a second one for us.  However, now after a year of usage the first echo we bought in early December 2017 fades in and out.  At first I thought maybe it was the internet connection but we have two dots and another echo and none of them fade in and out.  We have used this device most every day so maybe it is wearing out?  Nonetheless very disappointed if the unit will only last a year.  Lke to hear if anyone else is having this issue and did you find a way to resolve it.\\r\\n            ', \"Pretty much doesn't do anything I wanted it to do.  Useless as a doorstop.  I got to 1. keep an eye on the weather. 2. Be able to send messages by voice without my cell phone.  3. Use voice commands to use iTunes playlist.  So..in regards to 1 - will not give me local weather, I get weather from some city miles away.  I've input my location over and over and over and over again.  Hit save.  I still get weather from Manassas VA instead of Washington DC.  In regards to 2 - when I put my phone number in I get a message that my number is already linked to an account which it is not since I just got the damn thing.  And 3, I realize that Apple and Amazon hate each other but really?  If I can link it to my iPad I should be able to use a voice command to change the playlist and not have to manually put it in.\\r\\n            \", \"We received one of these as a gift and so far, in an area that has experience problems with power (thanks to some pretty intense storms) and internet connectivity, I've had to reset this device each time, which is a total pain. When the power goes out, and my local internet goes back on line a few moments later, this device cannot reestablish a connection, and I have to haul out my iPad and use it to bring this device back to life.Once, when the internet connectivity completely broke and I had to power cycle my internet modem to get it back, I had to completely reset this device and go all the way through the setup like I did when I first received it.Talk about a pain in the rear.So if you live in an area that experiences power outages and/or internet problems, do NOT spend your money until Amazon comes up with a device that can recover from both power outages and internet connectivity issues.This one, a second generation device, cannot and I don't know if the firmware in the device can even be upgraded.\\r\\n            \", \"Difficult to connect. Cannot run it from my phones hotspot although that is listed as an option . The only way to connect it is by running your app on a separate device than hotspot. An unpractical solution. Having to use 2 seperate phones to run it is ridiculous.  They need to stop advertising that option since ir is not a practical solution to areas that do not have high speed internet or wifi access . I spent a long time with customer service , he was rude and impatient, and didn't seem to have very much knowledge about how exactly to do his job. My time is valuable and I am very frustrated that Amazon's employee wasted my time. I am returning this device. After making this review customer service called me within 15 minutes,  repeatedly while I was at work and finally after subsequent calls disrupting my work day,  I answered. They were trying to make my echo experience better and asked me to connect in a different way. I told them I could not talk at that time and I didn't have the device with me anyways. I could not seem to politely get him to hang up. He kept drawing the conversation out . They said that if I put the app on a separate cell phone and used my Hotspot to connect to the echo that I could then delete the app off of the other phone and continue using the echo from my personal hotspot. But when I followed their directions and then deleted the other app on someone else's phone it disconnected me and I cannot reconnect. If you would like to use Alexa off of the home Wi-Fi it works great but they should stop advertising it as hotspot compatible because it is not a practical usage. Each and every time I go in and out of range with my cell phone to the echo I have to completely reconnect it using a secondary cell phone. It takes about 15 minutes to completely hook up the echo through hotspot, so I would have to do that when I reach the edge of my yard and came back every single time. I am very dissatisfied and I feel that it was deceptive advertising. Customer service has wasted my time multiple times now with no satisfaction to the echos usage. They are not informed about the real usage of the device or how to practically help users apply the steps of connectivity.Speaker crackles and is poor quality.I am beyond frustrated with this experience and it makes me less likely to purchase any other merchandise from them in the future.\\r\\n            \", \"Amazon outsources their technical support of the Alexa app.  This group is off shore and uses American names.

They then sell you a support plan. All of the software they download for you is free. You don't need to pay them to do it.  Beware!  the product itself was fine.

Their Rep was incredibly nice and helpful with other aspects but still No reasons as to why this keeps happening.\\r\\n            ', \"I bought an Echo Gen 2 about 4 months ago. In the past month music, particularly Amazon Music Unlimited, has been dropping. It plays for a bit, 1-5 minutes, then drops out. I contacted Amazon today through chat. They had me on there for over an hour and transferred me to 4 different agents, 2 of whom were supposedly technical specialists. They had me reboot. They had me factory reset. After an hour of this, the problem kept occurring. None of the reps had any ideas. They kept trying to blame my internet service. (I have between 85-120 Mbps where the Echo device is located.) I got so frustrated I ended the chat. An email popped up urging me to accept a call to resolve the issue. OK-- I accepted a call. A  rep got on and we began discussing the problem. Then the call abruptly disconnected. Very frustrated, I just left it alone for a while. A hour or so later I figured I'd take another shot. Called again. Went through the same routine. Reboot, reset, the problems kept happening. The agent was even on the phone when these events occurred and heard the problems. I got put on hold several times. Finally, after an hour of this, the rep comes back and says I need to contact my internet service provider. Like it was the internet's fault, rather than a malfunctioning Echo. I'd had it. I said that the device was the issue. I have many other Amazon Alexa devices (Dots, Spots, Taps, etc) and none were having a problem. I simply wanted them to fix or replace the faulty Echo. Easy. The thing is only 4 months old and has some issue. They refused. I just hung up again, more frustrated than ever. Extremely poor customer service from Amazon. I've been a Prime customer for many, many years. I buy most of my stuff from Amazon. But this experience has led to a very bad conclusion. You sometimes hear about what might happen after Amazon fully conquers the retail world. I think I just got a taste of it. Don't buy this product.***Update- the day after I posted this review I received a phone call from a customer relations supervisor. The individual was very nice and solicitous and offered to replace the device. I accepted.My take-away from this experience is that Amazon does eventually listen to its customers and also carefully monitors product reviews. I do not blame any of the customer service representatives for my bad experience. Rather, I believe the problem was a systemic one in which the Amazon customer service / technical support system was directing the reps to certain conclusions and to take certain actions. The end result was to look for fault in environmental factors (ie: bad internet / wifi service) rather than to the device itself. My recommendation to Amazon, again as a long-time customer (I remember when they just sold books), is to allow the customer service reps greater latitude and discretion or implement a system that is tuned better to accepting information from customers so that loops in which people are asked to perform repetitive tasks are not constantly repeated from one agent to another. I also feel that there was a bias in the system which directed the reps to look for external issues rather than look for fault in the device itself. There was no reason why a 4 month old device, which is still under warranty, required hours of basic technical support / customer support, given that information was provided (area wifi speeds, confirmation that other devices were functioning properly) to indicate that the fault may be internal.Ultimately, the faulty device is being replaced with a refurbished Amazon Echo. That was the solution I had been looking for since I first began the process. I feel that Amazon's systems did both myself and Amazon itself a disservice by provoking such an unnecessary series of events. I do thank the reps for their time and efforts and ultimately Amazon has proven itself to respond when given enough incentive.\\r\\n            \", 'Not responsive. I am returning it.

Amazon suddenly cancelled the Amazon music match service in an attempt to get you to pay a monthly fee for Amazon Music subscription service.  This service has less then 40% of my music available on it and is drastically more expensive then match.  I have 4 Echoes for sale and a Fire TV and Tablet.  This bait amd switch taught me a leason.

In all cases it just says \"I cant understand that.\" or says \"here\\'s a playlist you might like...oh, Alexa is streaming on another device. would you....\" There wasn\\'t any streaming elsewhere.

This is capable of providing booming volume that can be heard throughout my entire apartment but when I'm in the same room with the Echo playing music the sound is definitely below average, with a muddy quality that reproduces mids and highs very poorly.  My guess is that a bottom firing subwoofer on a small speaker that's going to be placed on a hard surface like a dresser or end table is a less than brilliant idea and the base is mushing up the mid and high frequencies.  Music played from the Echo sounds no better than a 1970's era transistor radio.Using this for Alexa is also problematic because if the volume is set high enough to hear songs clearly from 5 or 6 feet away then Alexa's voice ends up being piercingly loud like she's trying to be heard in a crowded club above the din of thumping dance music.  Turning the volume down on the Echo so Alexa isn't shouting and turning the media volume up to max on my smartphone results in music volume that is too low to enjoy.  I also streamed music from an Android tablet using a different app and the results were identical.You can control the volume separately in the Alexa app for notifications and media but for some reason, the Alexa voice is treated as media and notifications are considered alarms and timers and as far as I can tell basically nothing else which renders the separate volume controls pointless.You can also control the tone of the Echo speaker in the Alexa app but that doesn't really seem to improve the sound quality much if at all.There is simply no way this product is worth the $99 list price when it delivers sound quality inferior to a $40 Xiaomi Bluetooth speaker but at a lower price (currently $69) it might be worth considering depending on your expectations and needs.  If you primarily want to add Alexa to a room you are much better off getting the Echo Dot.\\r\\n            \", 'I have no idea how the Echo works as I was never able to get it to connect with my Wifi, even with the \"help\" of a Amazon tech.

I wish I could give it negative stars.My complaint is simple- the Echo/Alexa devices are essentially fancy tools which operate on voice command. That’s the gimmick. Yes, I could control it through my phone, but I can do that with a cheaper (and better) Bluetooth speaker and iTunes. The Echo registers its wake word about half the time. Of course, it also decides to “hear” the wake word in silence, or in any random conversation. When it hears the wake word AND the wake word has actually been said, it’s now a coin toss if it hears and does your request. Want to know the weather? Alexa might play you kidzbop. Want to play the top 40? Alexa could set you an alarm for 4am. Good luck trying to cancel it with voice controls.I’ve gone through letting the Alexa “learn” my voice. I’m pretty white- I don’t have a thick foreign accent.

I bought a two-pack. I downloaded the necessary Alexa app to my phone. I then set up the Echos with some difficulty – they piggyback off my phone’s network connections and my phone wasn’t configured to help Amazon. The suggested settings changes for my phone, including a picture on the Alexa app, didn’t exist (!), so I had to figure it out, but its lack of an easy, out-of-the-box setup was very frustrating. The Amazon Music Unlimited subscription I wanted at the $3.99 level couldn’t be shared by both Echos - I needed to set up a second subscription on my wife’s account - each of us had to subscribe. That feels like a rip-off. For classical music, even with the unlimited subscription, Alexa doesn’t find whole works. If you ask for a concerto, for example, Alexa might want to play only the second movement. Its top choice for the William Tell Overture, one of the most well-known classical pieces was a performance where the music wasn’t faithful to the score! I can only think Amazon approached classical music from one of two angles: either they developed the software algorithm to select music to work across all music genres in the same way - the atomic unit of music is the “song,” so a concerto consists of three “songs” and asking for Mozart’s 3rd violin concerto yields the (random?) 2nd movement. Or, it could be that Amazon hasn’t invested heavily in a classical library. The worst of my early experiences though is that there is a difference between the app on my phone and the Echo. I downloaded the Amazon music app to my phone. There, you can search for a piece, for example, Mozart’s 3rd violin concerto. You can find it as a whole piece, especially if you look at the associated albums in the search results. Then, you can use Bluetooth to have the music play on the Echo. It seemed wrong to me that Alexa couldn’t find a piece of music on the Echo, but I could find it in the app on my phone. I called Amazon. The rep and I tried to figure it out. We verified that I had an unlimited subscription by asking Alexa. After about 30 minutes, the rep told me she would create an “engineering note” and get back to me in a few days. Another small point, but one of the worst examples of their design: the Amazon Music app is a MUSIC player. The app has buttons for play, pause, go the next piece, go to the previous piece, but there is no volume control. Completely unintuitively, I had to go outside the music app, to my phone’s volume controls to adjust the volume on the Echo across the room. Summary: setup should have been much easier – if Amazon requires the user to change his phone’s network settings, it should make sure the instructions are up to date. I have a Samsung Galaxy s8+. The picture in the Alexa app showing what to do did not exist in my phone’s setup menus. Subscriptions: the emails sent to me and the general promotions I saw were for a $7.99 subscription to Amazon Music Unlimited. I had to search for the $3.99 subscription. I had to buy two; one for each Echo. I could have purchased the $14.99 subscription that would have applied to up to six Echos, but I didn’t want to spend the money – kind of like the $80 ink-jet printer with its $25 cartridges. Functionality: classical music is woeful, although to be fair, Alexa does seem to groove well to pop music.

I put the Gen 1 and Gen 2 side by side and used echo as wake work for Gen 1, Alexa as wake work for Gen 2. I went back and forth having each play a song to compare. Gen 2 has better bass but not as good overall. Frankly both sound pretty good to me but the claim of better sound in Gen 2 misses the mark. I recommend buying Gen 1.

I do not have that problem with my Gen 1. I contacted Amazon and they sent me a new one without a hassle. When I hooked the replacement up, the same issue was there. On Nov 3rd I contacted the Amazon Echo department, and they advised me that there was a known issue with the music on the Gen 2, and it would be fixed by Nov 6th. Well, today is Nov 8th and nothing's changed, so regrettably I am returning my second Gen 2. I might add, after reading other reviews, I agree that the quality of the sound from the Gen 2 is, at best, worse than my Gen 1. Voices are muffled and music is not crisp.

CHEAP!!!\\r\\n            ', 'To be fair, I must give some background information to this review.  When previously asked if we wanted an \"Alexa\", we said \"no\".  (We can\\'t figure out why anyone would need one of these, as we have phones that do pretty much everything this device is supposed to do.)  Not listening to us, a family member gave us one of these last Christmas, and we returned it to the store from which it was purchased.  This Christmas, another family member who has an Alexa and was also told we didn\\'t want one gave us two Echos in different colors as a gift for our children and then had us set them up while watching.  (I think this individual just really wanted us to use this device?)Two of our children like playing music in their room, and we wanted something that would play our iTunes.  The Echo does not do that.  Also, both devices cannot be used at the same time, because they\\'re on the same account.  What these devices did do was start flashing different colors in the middle of the night, waking up our kids, to tell us that we need to check an important message from \"Alexa\" and that Alexa had a \"gift\" for us (not a present - just unimportant info.).  When we tried to turn off the device, it started playing a song at a very loud volume and wouldn\\'t stop, so we had to unplug it and sort it out the next morning.  We ended up having to reset both devices and deselect most of the device options on our Amazon account.  While doing this online, we noticed Alexa had a list of every word our children had said to her - a little creepy.  We can understand having certain trigger words or phrases, such as if someone were asking her the best place to hide a body, but they were just telling her to say silly things, play songs, or provide the weather forecast.We are stuck with these Echo devices (and numerous emails from Amazon about them), but we don\\'t use them much.  Echo cannot play our paid-for songs in our iTunes, does not have many options for customizing (for example, choosing a unique name), and goes rogue in the middle of the night unless you turn off many options. Overall, unless you like a device ordering stuff for you or for your family whenever you tell it to, it just doesn\\'t make sense to have an Echo when we have smart phones.\\r\\n            ', \"Nowhere near as useful or good as a Google Assistant. I did a lot of research before buying because I wasnt sure whether to get the Alexa or Google Home. I asked questions, read reviews, etc. They seemed to have very similar reviews so I bought the Alexa when it was on sale. Initially it was fun and exciting but after having it for several months I am not impressed at all. It is definitely not even as useful as the Google Assistant on my phone. I use that far more than the Alexa. Everyone said, the more you use it, the more it learns, so we really tried doing that and it did not make a difference. It constantly didn't know or doesn't understand, even basic stuff. It can't come up with answers from a basic Google search. It sometimes recites from Wikipedia, but other times can't, which makes no sense. It's become an expensive timer we use once a day at bedtime. It really is very unimpressive and a huge let down. It will also randomly speak up when no one says anything to it, or even when there isn't any noise. It once woke us up answering something no one asked. Visited my sister, who got the Google home, and it worked so much better. It was even better than the assistant on my phone. Would NOT recommend. If you want something like this, go for the Google Home. Regret buying. Wish I could return it but we didn't realize it was basically useless until after the return period was over bcs I bought it as a family Christmas present so we didn't use it right away.Update: I received great customer service based off of this review from Tim B. He helped in every way he could. Unfortunately the Alexa still couldn't do what I wanted and continued to malfunction. He seemed genuinely surprised by some of the things, so it may have been a dud. However, I was specifically told it can not do Google searches by an Amazon employee. So all the ppl answering questions saying that it can do everything a Google home can, according to Amazon, are incorrect. The skills (apps for it basically) often worked very poorly. It was shocking how poorly some worked and nothing was ever changed even though the reviews on the skill were all bad. I don't recommend purchasing this item still. I do appreciate the great customer service I received from Tim.Though for some reason, other employees have called me about this review, in fact I was called by 3 separate employees today, which is insane, considering I actually told one they have to stop calling and then got called again! My opinion of the product has not changed and I will not change my review and lie. Tim was incredibly helpful and I really appreciated his help. I would also appreciate it if other employees stopped calling me in what appears to be an attempt to get me to change my review. Well I guess it worked, but probably not what they wanted. If I continue to be badgered about this review I will update it again listing exactly what it did, and I'm certain they don't want that.\\r\\n            \", \"I got this item first, while waiting for the echo show to arrive.

I really want to return this device and the tower echo and buy the Google Portal.  This thing is so limited its unreal.  I didn't know I couldn't access the internet to watch videos...this was not published well. I can't make video calls very easy either, it's always voice calls - even to those with the echo show.  I tried to get Alexa to tell me how to re-heat corn on the cob and she kept giving me recipes for corn on the cob.  Even when I speak slowly and articulate carefully, I still have issues.

Also Amazon basically has not tech support. If you call them about echo problems you\\'ll probably know more than they do as it\\'s some offshore location. Classic case of not supporting a product after they sell it and letting the users develop a forum for Q&A problems.The issue is that they make software changes that suddenly wipe out routines that you program in place to turn things on and off. Then you go crazy trying to troubleshoot and fix it. These conveniences are supposed to make life easier not annoy you. I\\'ve talked to others on line that have had similar experiences.As I mentioned, Alexa is a fun novelty to say, he Alexa, play some Beatles songs\" or something like that.

It was easier to just turn the top for the volume than using the buttons on this one.  I\\'ve also noticed that the new one doesn\\'t connect or disconnect to bluetooth by command as well as the old one.

But the Echo ecosystem is a disappointment.  It’s nothing compared to what its marketing and the potential of its technology led me to expect.  I predict it will be a revolutionary sysstem some day, a system I will recommend to everyone.  But that day is not in the immediate future.Before dissing it, I’ll give it credit for being physically attractive.  The sound is great for its size.  The cost is reasonable.  For simple things like timers, alarms, jukebox, the spoken interface is convenient and works well.  And with multiple devices, it’s a good intercom.  It’s pretty easy to set up.  And support is a as good as the rest of Amazon customer support, which is the best in the industry.  And Amazon doesn’t filter out negative reviews like most competitors .  So you may get a chance to read what follows.  That’s all the praise I can offer.The flaws are glaring.  I fully expected the marketing demonstrations and examples to be misleading, as is the custom in IT advertising.  I didn’t even expect Alexa language skills to equal Google’s interpretation of spoken English.  But I expected it to be much better than it is.  As a rough idea, it’s where Google was five to 10 years ago in language interpretation, or about where Microsoft and Apple are today.  It may even be worse than Apple, though it’s close.  In other words, it rarely understands what you say until you accept that reality and learn the limited repertoire of commands that it recognizes.Its Alexa app on the iPhone is not intuitive.  When you finally figure it out, you realize it’s poorly designed and often doesn’t work.  Of the thousands of “skills,” I found on the app, hardly any are of use to me.  Except for several subscription services, I don’t even recognize most of them.  People who have reviewed them, give the vast majority poor reviews.The biggest disappointment for me was that Echo devices cannot even access the contacts, calendars, tasks, email or anything else that I keep in my Microsoft Exchange mailbox.  Yes, Microsoft Exchange is one of the most common mail servers in the world.  Possibly the most prolific.  But Alexa, alone among all the productivity software I’m familiar with, cannot access a Microsoft Exchange mailbox unless you set up a business account with Amazon.  Every smartphone in the world can access an Exchange mailbox.  But not Alexa.Another minor criticism that won’t affect most people: Echo devices have a sophisticated setup process that should be explained better to prevent paranoia.  I plugged in a new Echo Dot that, by itself, automatically connected to my secured home Wi-Fi LAN.  It took me two hours on the phone with Amazon support and two escalations to find out how it got my Wi-Fi passwords.  As it turns out, you cannot just buy an Echo device, go to some stranger’s house and control everything in it.\\r\\n            ', \"After struggling and a Little Help from customer service I was able to get this thing connected.

I will say that Amazon has awesome customer service, within a few minutes of posting a poor review I had gotten a phone call and emails on how to resolve the issues. This is why I love Amazon and why they crush the competition. The jury is still out on whether I needed this thing on the even like it, but once again Amazon came through with their service.I was never informed that I have to pay an extra $78 a month for the Amazon unlimited streaming to use this device properly even though I'm a Prime member.

Sometimes Alexa has no trouble finding my playlists on Amazon Prime, but at other times it cannot find playlists, even when I stand right next to the device, use my best elocution, and ensure that I have the name exactly right by reading it directly from my phone.

I suppose it's possible that the kitchen device sees a lot more white noise or other random sounds so it's having a harder time recognizing commands, but regardless, I didn't have that issue when the original Echo was in the kitchen.

I asked her about the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York because we wanted to know what special exhibition was showing. The Met is one of the most famous art museums in the world, but Alexa had never heard of it, because Amazon doesn’t sell it. I had seen the Apple equivalent and thought Echo would similarly be a source of information. I did not buy this product at Amazon, and it’s quite possible the salesperson at the retail outlet we bought it from misrepresented Echo’s capabilities. Maybe he was just ignorant, but I don’t see an honest description of the product  on Amazon itself.

Audio quality for the Alexa voice is still pretty muddy compared to the Echo Gen 1. I am returning the six Echo Gen 2 devices that I bought and replacing them with Echo Gen 1 devices.

I am planning on returning all six, after having configured and used three of them for a few days. The sound quality of this device is horrible. I use my Echo for home control, flash briefings, dad jokes, etc... and not much for music (I control Sonos with Alexa for music).

The potential is huge for the future. It is so easy to get the hook on talking rather than typing. At the rate you come up with new questions that Alexa could answer, you will also realize the limitations. Alexa is very basic. The abilities (skills) are mostly annoying, as in some cases you need to remember exact phrases to even get an approximate response.Alexa is far from being intelligent - today. There are no real interactions. For most cases every question is treated individually, you cannot have a conversation by asking follow-up questions. Rarely Alexa can relate anything to the previous questions (examples: you can stop a timer or tell it, the answer was not useful), but many times you would like to drill deeper into an answer.Amazon is not able to gather real big players to develop skills. I'd say 99% of the skills connecting to some other service providers are from thirdparties or not available. Examples: Gmail, iTunes, Wunderlist, Microsoft To-Do, Shazam are all not available. I would never give permission to a unknown developer to access my emails! And yet these integrations would just be perfect. It's great to set a timer or reminder (which is probably the thing I use most currently), but I would like to have Alexa translate it in a natural way, not begging a skill name in an obscure way to translate. Even the new built in translation skill is only from English to another language. Sad again, as when you are reading a book in let's say French you would like to ask Alexa to quickly translate a word to English - not possible, not even with other skills.Actually it is frustrating because I have that many questions to Alexa that today do not work, and Amazon would be in a position to bridge the worlds of Google, Apple and Microsof. I am convinced all these including Amazon want to protect their own universes and forget the clients. Why can Google not be on board and be part of Alexa? It would be great to at least listen (or in the future on some newer devices watch) YouTube. Have Alexa read my emails would be a dream.Why has there no advance with Microsoft Corana to combine forces with Alexa?Why can it not integrate with Apple? I'd love to control iTunes through Alexa?Why can I not configure a different To Do list like Wunderlist or MS To-To? Using the Amazon app to shop in anything other than Amazon is downright unusable.The lack of native/original skills is a big hindarance for this being your digital assistant. It is still a far shot from being an assistant. Right now it is a monkey with mask of Einstein ;-).** original rating 4 stars **The device itself is great once set up (5 stars), sound is good and clear also for music.Alexa itself is also cool - 4 stars:1) You can tell there is not that much AI yet as everyone from the tec communitiy would like to make you believe, but the great thing is that this will keep improving.2) Unfortunately not all countries are supported (e.g. Switzerland).What is rather unpleasant is the set up process as soon it is not the standard or you need to fix something - 2 stars:1) My app shows Japanese rather than English and I have no idea where it takes that from. [Update: that was fixed in the app by resetting the language to English US]2) Echo does not seem to work on all networks as I have trouble to connect it to some of my WiFi networks.  [Update: Eventually I got it working fine, I had to update the WLAN router firmware]3) There is no error guidance from the app - you need to go to a browser for trouble shooting. This is most annoying, as it would be great to be guided through the error finding steps.4) The different light modes are not explained in the app.5) There are no global settings for your Echo devices, you need to configure the values like location for each individually.6) The app is not nicely done, actually it does just the basics.\\r\\n            \", 'Really loved this for the few months it worked well.

This is SLOW and very CUMBERSOME.  At the least, I should be able, to select a SINGLE DEVICE and SELECT DELETE ALL.  This is NOT an option on the ALEXA APP.  I have 5-devices that RECORD.  So consider if I have 5-devices, and each device has 10-to-15-different recordings, that means I have to hit \"DELETE\" 50-to-75-times before I have DELETED all of my so-called HISTORY!  If I could do it at the DEVICE level, I would only have to do it 5-times.  Seriously, deleting recordings is a very difficult thing.And, I am very annoyed at the BIG GLARING RED CIRCLE on top of each ECHO, when I MUTE the microphones!  It really should GLOW RED for perhaps 1-minute, then; VERY SLOWLY, BLINK RED - where by - it is OFF for 5-seconds, then slow FLASH red for 2-seconds, then 5-seconds off, then 2-seconds on.  Or something like that.  NOT that UGLY --CONSTANT-- RED RING on top when ever the microphones are OFF.  Seriously. guys?2018-MAR-29 Follow on - REVISED.I still have an ISSUE - but - I MUST revise my statement.  According to AMAZON, it does not record unless Alexa hears her wake word, and; then you are only going to be recorded for what \"she\" must hear, in order to respond properly to your request.THAT is what Amazon says will happen.  BUT,It also says you can DELETE the recordings via the ALEXA APP.  That is NOT TRUE.  I have the ALEXA APP on my SAMSUNG phone, and; there is absolutely NO WAY TO DELETE RECORDINGs from that device.  It is NOT supported there.  Moreover, as it appears that I can only delete recordings from my laptop, there is still NO FEEDBACK that when I ask for my recordings to be deleted, that they are actually DELETED.  As I stated before, it says a \"request is acknowledged\" but not actually \"done\".And it SAYS that if you push the microphone button, that it shuts off the microphones on the device.  I am dubious if this is true, and; it is really ANNOYING that it shines RED when you do this.  Why not shine RED for a Moment, then BLINK VERY SLOW RED, until you turn it on again?  If I want to leave it OFF, for hours, or even DAYS - I don\\'t want to therefore WASTE the light - or over time burn the LED out.Still, when I first reviewed my recordings here, there were several instances where stuff I did NOT want RECORDED was actually recorded.  And a LOT of crap from my TV, where Alexa responded to the TV that was playing, and recorded useless stuff from there.  So, I apologize to AMAZON for my outburst saying they are recording us, they are, but \"NOT SO MUCH\" as I believed.I am still in doubt, and dubious about DELETE.  Why can I NOT simply say, \"Alexa - delete my recordings.\"???********Okay, I have a serious ISSUE with the ALEXA interface.  I just learned, that ALEXA and my ECHO devices, are, according to AMAZON, \"Constantly Listening\".  Okay, I get it.  It has to \"Listen\" to know when you are ASKING it to do things for you.  Fine.BUT, did you also know it is CONSTANTLY RECORDING?  That\\'s right.  It is not MERELY LISTENING.  It is also CONSTANTLY RECORDING EVERYTHING that is making SOUND in your HOME!AND, the ONLY WAY TO DELETE THOSE RECORDINGS, is to LOGIN TO AMAZON, via a LAPTOP, and MANAGE those recordings.  WORSE, even when you order them to DELETE MY RECORDINGS, it does not do that!  It says, \"Your Request has been SENT\"  You never EVER get an actual acknowledgement that the RECORDINGS are BEING DELETED!There are those who try to draw attention to \"This could be used against you in Law Enforcement\".I am doing NOTHING that matters in that regard.  THAT is not why I CARE about being RECORDED ALL THE FRAKKING TIME!Consider the more OBVIOUS PRIVACY ISSUES - that have absolutely NOTHING to do with being ILLEGAL or such like:Do YOU WANT AMAZON RECORDING YOU ....  * You reminding the kid(s) of the FRONT DOOR LOCK code?  * You discussing your private FINANCIAL facts with your spouse?  * You lecturing your kid about DRUGS?  * How about you and your mate making LOVE at night?  * THAT - is why AMAZON ECHO RECORDing is BAD.  Listening?  Sure, I get that.  But RECORDING?  And NOT DELETING THEM EASILY by saying:  ALEXA - DELETE ALL OF MY RECORDINGS RIGHT NOW!  You CAN\\'T.  And I, personally, have a SERIOUS ISSUE WITH THAT.  RECORDING?  That I cannot merely say, \"ALEXA DELETE MY RECORDINGS\"?  WHY NOT???!!!2017-DEC-07 Follow onAll in all, I like this device.  It plays my Amazon music very well, and; the \"daily briefings\" and \"Reuters News\" are nice to have.  I hope that as time passes, I will find more things to do.  It is fun to ask Alexa things just to see what she \"knows\".  I think Amazon should make it more clear where to go to learn more.  Perhaps a devoted web page or three.The ONLY thing that is \"funny\" and \"off\", is that I have mine seated near one of my TVs.  And, Randomly, when I am watching shows, the sound from the TV activates Alexa, and; it is funny to hear her respond to the TV rather than to me.  No complaint about that.  It is impossible for it to not happen.  Though it is really funny when it does!The sound quality is outstanding.  And, NOW I have two of them paired.  They play music very well in sync.  I\\'m a TECH, so; it makes me wonder what kind of firmware algorithm is used to make it so perfectly synced.  Cudoz to the men and women who made that possible.  I know that it had to be a serious challenge to make it so!If you want a laugh or three, ask Alexa to sing and also to tell you stories.;O)2017-NOV-22 Follow onOkay, really, it is a nice device.  It needs MORE functionality, but; it is overall, a good buy, if you want help with your memory and lists and reminders and such like.  I found that the recurring reminder is there, just not obvious - though - it should be.  Search on Amazon.  I\\'m working on it now.  As for Alexa, for some of us, nice is important.  One GLARING oversight...  She does not respond to courtesy.  You folks need to get her to RESPOND to \"Thank You Alexa\" with \"You are welcome.\" or better, \"You\\'re Welcome Roger.\" or \"You are very welcome!\"  AND best, a combination of either response - or even all three of them, randomly, whenever the user says, \"Thanks Alexa\" or \"Thank you Alexa\". or even just \"Thank you\" and \"Thanks\".  It should be no issue for it to recognize at nice THANK YOU and reply.  The ability to do so would add to the illusion that Alexa is your \"friendly helper\".  Food for thought.---------------------------------------------------(original posting)This is my initial thoughts ONLY.  I am still getting to know this device.  So far, the PRO(s) are, it is smaller than I thought it would be, which is nice.  and, the sound quality is fabulous!  It plays my Amazon Prime music very nicely.  Alexa responds very well to my voice without any special \"training\", from 10-feet away across the room.  I don\\'t have to \"yell at it\" or anything.  Just speak to her normally.  That\\'s really nice.  And, the Alexa voice is easy to understand, and; well programmed to reply.CON(s), though only MINOR:  I had to EJECT then, REMOVE the SD-CARD, and also REBOOT my phone, to get the ALEXA APP to install on my NOTE 4 running Droid 4.4.4.  Before doing that, I wasted nearly an hour trying over, and over, to download and install the app.  It downloaded fine, but; REFUSED to install.  And on every failed install, it would \"claim\" it could not download.  My download manager showed clearly that it was downloading fine.Frankly, I do NOT like that I must use my PHONE to \"configure\" and \"modify\" the settings for this device.  THAT was not clear online.  I would think AMAZON would ALSO supply me with a WINDOWS application for this.  But, so far, I cannot find one.  Seriously, it would be nice to NOT have to use ONLY my phone for the setup and reconfiguration activities.  Yes, I know the CHILDREN do EVERYTHING on their phones.  BUT, I am a DINOSAUR, and I use my LAPTOP far more than my phone for \"things\".  Just a thought.The built in activities are rather LIMITED.  It does NEWS only from Reuters, and; will NOT allow me to RE-DO the news for \"today\".  That is annoying.  I don\\'t always get to catch all of the information on the first pass.  So, it seems that I should be able to RE-LISTEN to the same news cast - on DEMAND - All the time.  But, once you have done the news \"today\", Alexa says, \"You\\'ve already listened to your news\" and refuses to do it again for \"today\".I have not YET done it, but; I like that I can set up the device to REMIND ME of things, \"to-do\", and; also - to put things in my Amazon cart, and; also to BUY THINGs without being on the laptop, and; to give me order status alerts for Amazon purchases.  I look forward to trying these features.BAD BAD BAD is...She does a terrible job of reading my KINDLE BOOKS.  So bad in fact, that; it is not really worth doing.  You cannot tell Alexa to SKIP over the Table of contents, or GOTO PAGE 1 or GOTO CHAPTER 3.  Nothing like that.  You cannot tell her to SKIP a page, or RE-READ anything.  AND the biggest problem, she reads FAR TOO FAST.  And telling her to \"READ SLOWER\" appears to do something, but; really - she reads at a breakneck pace, and; there is not way to make her read slower.I will report again when I have had time to try the other things it clams to do.  But so far, I LIKE the ECHO, and; the Alexa app is seamless with it.  If Amazon can make it READ MY KINDLE BOOKS - and not keep telling me to get an AUDIBLE ACCOUNT, that would be a greatly appreciated thing to improve!2017-NOV-19 - additional follow-up:Okay, in general, this device works well.  Some thoughts about how it can be IMPROVED.  When talking to the device, it would be good if Alexa responded to polite interactions.  If I say, \"Alexa, Thank You\", she should reply with \"You\\'re Welcome!\"  or even \"You\\'re Welcome Roger.\"  Another Improvement, would be, to allow VOLUME to be SOFTWARE DRIVEN.  Today, I MUST walk across the room to make it LOUDER or SOFTER.  By pushing the VOLUME buttons.  BUT, that is rather counter-intuitive.  Since it does \"everything else\" by voice....  It makes sense that it would ALSO allow me to say, \"Alexa, Volume Up please.\"  \"Alexa.  Volume Down please\".  And, \"Alexa, MUTE please\"  \"Alexa, UN-MUTE please\".  With positive reply from Alexa, like:  \"Your Device will be muted until you UN-MUTE or restart it\".  And, \"Your device is now UN_MUTED Roger.\"It could, and perhaps should, also have a few more APPs available.  I cannot say, for sure, what they might be.  But, interaction between Alexa and the USER is the key.  For instance, since it has TIMER(s) and REMINDER(s), it would be good to be able to have it, perform actions every day at given times--Recurring Reminders. The obvious reminders like:  \"Roger, It\\'s NOON - time for lunch.\"  or \"Roger, it\\'s 7pm, time to call your Mother.\"  Stuff like that - that repeat - DAILY.I still think Alexa should be able to READ my KINDLE books, with a SLOWER PACE.  And, be told to SKIP pages, or even chapters.\"  Right now, it annoyingly reads every single thing, including table of contents, etc.  And, it does NOT remember where it left off.  This would be useful.  To have Alexa READ a kindle, and; like me, place a bookmark, and resume reading by saying, \"Roger, we last left off in Chapter ###, page ###.\"  Being even smarter, would be to BACKUP a paragraph, or so, when resuming.  BUT, that would be far beyond what I am sure these young developers are capable of doing.In summary:  The ECHO is a solid device.  It\\'s sound quality is outstanding!  And, it does a very nice job of playing my AMAZON music.  It should have some improvements like:  (A) Allow (also) LAPTOP - not merely PHONE - to interface with the device; (B) Allow (also) for SOFTWARE volume UP/DOWN/MUTE/UN_MUTE; (C) Have REPEATED REMINDERS; (D) Have PACE variable speed READING of KINDLE BOOKS; (E) Have MORE built-in applications - and perhaps more NEW(s) source options.I hope to see some of these improvements in 2018.;O)\\r\\n            ', 'I like it for the Music and adding things to my shopping list.

Very disappointing as it should CLEARLY state this does not with CHROMEBOOK.Contacted what I thought was customer support for Echo and I got hacked ................This product is a huge liability if you care at all about your security for any and all devices.I read a review that Echo 2nd generation by far exceeded sound quality of Bose II speaker so that is why I bought this as I did not think that Bose II speaker was loud enough.  Well the Bose basically connected itself once I gave access to my blue tooth device.\\r\\n            \", \"We bought this for music as one thing and we can not get very much unless we want to pay a monthly fee.  Our kids and friends have the echo one and they get all kinds of free music.  Asking questions the echo doesn't answer most of them and shuts itself off.  This was a Christmas gift for my wife and saying we are very disappointed would put it mildly!\\r\\n            \", \"Expectations were high but the reality of Echo falls WAY short. This device is primarily a tool for Amazon to sell you monthly subscriptions for music and Prime. Alexa will simply not answer many questions, especially political ones, and claims not to know a lot of things that you would expect her to. Clearly she has been programmed to steer clear of any topic that might be considered controversial, which lowers her fun quotient considerably. She refuses to report point spreads and over/under on sports - what's up with that??? And the ability to turn on/off various appliances is not nearly as seamless as one might expect. Pricey, additional devices are required as well as a rather convoluted synchronization process that requires internet connectivity. It's do-able, but hardly plug-and-play. On the other hand, the sound quality of this particular device is pretty robust considering its size - but don't think it's going to replace true hi-fi equipment for serious listening. Bottom line, Echo is mostly a curiosity. I gave it to my girlfriend for Christmas and we hardly use it at all after only two weeks. The novelty wore off quickly. I would not buy another one or recommend that anybody else do so.\\r\\n            \", 'The Echo 2 is really good especially being able to send messages to our original echo but after a year and a half of enjoying prime music on two devices (echo and a tap) we have now found out you have to pay $7.99 a month for unlimited music that we have had for two years with no extra cost, bad move Amazon, so we sent the device back and I am now using tap as a Bluetooth speaker only\\r\\n            ', 'Not sure exactly what the purpose of this is, beyond playing on-demand music and getting a weather report. The sound quality is suspect, but that may be due to the location, as I have heard others that sound really good. The good is the are not expensive and don’t take up a lot of room.\\r\\n            ', 'I agree with other reviewers.  The sound is no where near as good as the original Echo or the Tap.  I was so excited to get these; I had planned on giving two as gifts.  I bought three, but will be returning all of them.\\r\\n            ', 'After 4 months my Echo is \"off line\".  After hours of reading and trying all the tips, I called Customer Service. This was an even greater waste of time. I tried everything he suggested and still nothing.  Now the app won\\'t work - after I uninstalled twice.  This is the first thing I have ever ordered from Amazon that I wasn\\'t satisfied with when received.  I have spent the whole day trying to make Alexa work again. I am throwing out the Echo  -\\r\\n            ', 'I have an Echo and a Prime membership. This piece has no voice recognition whatsoever. Don’t buy it. The artificial intelligence is way weaker than Siri from the IPhone.\\r\\n            ', 'If you\\'re searching for an Alexa enabled speaker to listen to music on look elsewhere. The sound quality on this speaker is a huge letdown and step down from the first generation device. After listening to a couple of songs on Spotify I had it back in it\\'s packaging to be returned. I\\'m not exaggerating when I say that a portable speaker that was purchased at fraction of the cost of this device sounds more lively.Putting \"improved sound\" in the item title is incredibly misleading. The sound output on this is not at all comparable to the first generation Echo.\\r\\n            ', \"I have a love-hate relationship with this product. Mostly hate though. Alexa literally knows nothing compared to siri.
